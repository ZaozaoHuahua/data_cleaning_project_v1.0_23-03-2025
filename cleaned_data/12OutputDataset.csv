148223,E19E98C5-FC54-4D69-9CD5-D6676FB69FAE,A plant biodiversity effect resolved to a single genetic locus - datasets,"Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and genetics, we identified a major effect locus that promotes complementarity amongst genotypes and above-ground productivity in mixed communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect can act independently of other genomic regions and be resolved to a single locus representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant-soil-feedback experiments, we demonstrate that allelic diversity also causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a subsequent growing period. Our work thus shows that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties, some of which manifest themselves even after the original community has disappeared, can have a simple, single cause. This may pave the way to novel breeding strategies, focussing on phenotypic properties that manifest themselves beyond isolated individuals, i.e. at a higher level of biological organisation.",10.5281/zenodo.1254563,2018-06-21,https://zenodo.org,Zenodo

Nevertheless, the application of the developed designs is limited by either high cost of their manufacturing or low conversion efficiencies. This paper reports on the efficient second-harmonic generation in a free-standing GaP nanowire array encapsulated in a polymer membrane. Light coupling with optical resonances and field confinement in the nanowires together with high nonlinearity of GaP material yield a strong second-harmonic signal and efficient near-infrared (800-1200 nm) to visible upconversion. The fabricated nanowire-based membranes demonstrate high flexibility and semitransparency for the incident infrared radiation, allowing utilizing them for infrared imaging, which can be easily integrated into different optical schemes without disturbing the visualized beam.",10.1021/acsnano.0c04872,2020-08-25,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/439005,ETH server

It alternates between warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina) states, with global impacts on climate and society. This study provides new ENSO reconstructions based on a large, updated collection of proxy records. We use a novel reconstruction approach that employs running principal components, which allows us to take covariance changes between proxy records into account and thereby identify periods of likely teleconnection changes. Using different implementations of the principal component analysis enables us to identify periods within the last millennium when quantifications of ENSO are most robust. These periods range from 1580 to the end of the 17th century and from 1825 to present. We incorporate an assessment of consistency among our new and existing ENSO reconstructions leading to five short phases of low agreement among the reconstructions between 1700 and 1786. We find a consistent spatial pattern of proxy covariance during these four phases, differing from the structure seen over the instrumental period. This pattern points towards changes in teleconnections in the west Pacific/Australasian region, compared to the present state. Using our new reconstructions, we find a significant response of ENSO towards more La Nina-like conditions 3-5 years after major volcanic events. We further show that our new reconstructions and existing reconstructions largely agree on the state of ENSO during volcanic eruptions in the years 1695 and 1784, which helps put into perspective the climatic response to these events. During all other large volcanic eruptions of the last 1000 years, there is no reconstruction coherency with regard to the state of ENSO.",https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/25891,2019-04-04,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/25891,NOAA paleoclimate database
154802,EE6AD03D-4674-4BCE-81A4-1DEBB60F3509,PAGES Antarctica2k Temperature Reconstructions,"Climate trends in the Antarctic region remain poorly characterized, owing to the brevity and scarcity of direct climate observations and the large magnitude of interannual to decadal-scale climate variability. Here, within the framework of the PAGES Antarctica2k working group, we build an enlarged database of ice core water stable isotope records from Antarctica, consisting of 112 records. We produce both unweighted and weighted isotopic (d18O) composites and temperature reconstructions since 0 CE, binned at 5- and 10-year resolution, for seven climatically distinct regions covering the Antarctic continent. Following earlier work of the Antarctica2k working group, we also produce composites and reconstructions for the broader regions of East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the whole continent. We use three methods for our temperature reconstructions: (i) a temperature scaling based on the d18O-temperature relationship output from an ECHAM5-wiso model simulation nudged to ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalyses from 1979 to 2013, and adjusted for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet region to borehole temperature data, (ii) a temperature scaling of the isotopic normalized anomalies to the variance of the regional reanalysis temperature and (iii) a composite-plus-scaling approach used in a previous continent-scale reconstruction of Antarctic temperature since 1 CE but applied to the new Antarctic ice core database. Our new reconstructions confirm a significant cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE across all Antarctic regions where records extend back into the 1st millennium, with the exception of the Wilkes Land coast and Weddell Sea coast regions. Within this long-term cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE, we find that the warmest period occurs between 300 and 1000 CE, and the coldest interval occurs from 1200 to 1900 CE. Since 1900 CE, significant warming trends are identified for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Dronning Maud Land coast and the Antarctic Peninsula regions, and these trends are robust across the distribution of records that contribute to the unweighted isotopic composites and also significant in the weighted temperature reconstructions. Only for the Antarctic Peninsula is this most recent century-scale trend unusual in the context of natural variability over the last 2000 years. However, projected warming of the Antarctic continent during the 21st century may soon see significant and unusual warming develop across other parts of the Antarctic continent.

To initiate their assembly, coordinated actions of multiple proteins are needed. Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a key player in the cilium assembly pathway, controlling final step of cilia initiation. The function of TTBK2 in ciliogenesisis critically dependent on its kinase activity, however, precise mechanism of action of this kinase is so far incompletely understood, in part due to very limited information about its relevant substrates. In this study we identify CEP83, CEP89, CCDC92, Rabin8 and DVL3 as substrates of TTBK2 kinase activity. Further, we characterise a set of phosphosites of the newly identified substrates and CEP164, induced by TTBK2 in vitro and in vivo and show that TTBK2 preferentially phosphorylates examined substrates at intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Intriguingly, we further show that identified TTBK2 phosphosites and consensus sequence delineated from those are distinct from motifs previously assigned to TTBK2. Finally, we address functional relevance of selected phosphorylations of CEP164 and provide evidence that the examined TTBK2-induced phosphorylations of CEP164 are relevant for the process of cilia formation. In summary, our work provides important insight into substrates-TTBK2 kinase relationship and suggests that multiple phosphorylation of IDRs is probably involved in the control of ciliogenesis in human cells.",PXD014199,2020-03-25,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD014199,PRIDE (Proteomics identifications database)

The authorities were created in 2013, following a change to the Swiss Civil Code (ZGB) adopted by the Swiss Parliament. Whereas most of the French-speaking cantons were able to continue working within the existing system, the changes to the Civil Code led to organizational changes in the German-speaking cantons and the Ticino.Our analysis will begin in the 1990s, when the first meetings on the reform of the guardianship system, as child and adult protection services were referred to back then, took place. We will then track the reform on the national level as well as its implementation on the cantonal level at the turn of the millennium. This will be followed by an analysis of the debate in the media and its implications for today.",https://doi.org/10.23662/FORS-DS-1271-1,,https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/17485/0/,FORS

This lecture presents the Swiss National Science Foundation MARK16 project (2018-2023), with its first results and its virtual research environment, https://mark16.sib.swiss. Secondly, it will summarize the main results of a forthcoming ZNT 2021 article about the Latin Codex Bobiensis, or Codex k, or VL 1, or G.VII.15. Of ambiguous reputation, this manuscript ends Mark with a shorter ending slightly different from the Greek one, with a puzzling expression et qui cum puero erant - “and those who were with the boy”. The MARK16 project has chosen to transcribe this expression by et qui cum puero erant, whereas its editing presents et qui cum Petro erant, as the lecture will argue. Last but not least, the enquiry highlights an alternative tradition, present in some versions of the shorter ending: Peter’s companions - and not the women - are reporting briefly instructions before the final apparition of Jesus himself. This finding fosters further the inquiry about Mark endings, by drawing the scholarly attention to VL 1, a manuscript contemporaneous of GA 01 and GA 03.",https://doi.org/11280/dc8c7c4f,2020-10-21,https://nakala.fr/11280/dc8c7c4f,Nakala

These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits which control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves, are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean Sphaeroforma genus - close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages - we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least two distinct physical mechanisms. We first find a dramatic >300x variation in sedimentation rate for different Sphaeroforma species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained fast settling S. arctica isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal “clumping” multicellular variants with increased size and density. Additionally, density increases arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in four additional species from the Sphaeroforma genus, suggesting variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By sequencing evolved isolates, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodelling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the evolution of multicellularity.",doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453070,2021-07-23,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453070,BioRxiv

The choice of such references -i.e., templates- and atlases is one relevant source of methodological variability across studies, which has recently been brought to attention as an important challenge to reproducibility in neuroscience. TemplateFlow is a publicly available framework for human and nonhuman brain models. The framework combines an open database with software for access, management, and vetting, allowing scientists to distribute their resources under FAIR -findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable- principles. TemplateFlow supports a multifaceted insight into brains across species, and enables multiverse analyses testing whether results generalize across standard references, scales, and in the long term, species, thereby contributing to increasing the reliability of neuroimaging results.Please visit www.templateflow.org for a more comprehensive description of this project. News and some discussions take place at the Nipy discourse platform [https://nipy.discourse.group/c/nipreps/9].## VisionThe rationale behind TemplateFlow and how we envision it as a fundamental instrument to neuroimaging studies is presented in our preprint:    Ciric R. et al., 2021. doi:10.1101/2021.02.10.430678",RRID:SCR_021876,2021-01-10,https://templateflow.org,TemplateFlow

148223,32477AF2-98F8-4430-8290-A850C582E8C3,Data for: Increasing plant group productivity through latent genetic variation for cooperation,"Technologies for crop breeding have become increasingly sophisticated, yet it remains unclear whether these advances are sufficient to meet future demands. A major challenge with current crop selection regimes is that they are often based on individual performance. This tends to select for plants with “selfish” traits, which leads to a yield loss when they compete in high-density stands. In traditional breeding, this well-known “tragedy of the commons” has been addressed by anticipating ideotypes with presumably preferential characteristics. However, this approach is limited to obvious architectural and physiological traits, and it depends on a mechanistic understanding of how these modulate growth and competition. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation of plants in stands; it is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation incur a cost to the individual but benefit the monoculture group. Testing the approach using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we found a single major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased levels of cooperation and superior monoculture productivity. We show that the allele likely affects a pleiotropic regulator of growth and defense, since it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher race-specific resistance against a specialized parasite. Even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might thus maintain latent genetic variation for it in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could be rapidly leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.",10.5281/zenodo.2659735,2019-05-21,https://zenodo.org,Zenodo

De l’hypothèse d’une théologie autobiographi,"Intitulée « TROISIÈME TESTAMENT » ET NOUVELLE ÉVANGÉLISATION. L’autobiographie comme composante analogique de la Révélation. De l’hypothèse d’une théologie autobiographique à une pastorale autobiographique d’évangélisation, et composée de sept chapitres pour une longueur d’environ 800 pages, la thèse de Massimiliano Scalici est destinée à un public varié du fait du sujet envisagé, à savoir l’autobiographie. Bien qu’exploré foncièrement sous l’angle théologique, ce thème suscite l’intérêt de diverses disciplines humaines. De fait, ce travail est entièrement traversé par une approche interdisciplinaire impliquant d’autres domaines scientifiques à côté de la théologie, notamment la narratologie, les théories autobiographiques (P. Lejeune, G. Gusdorf, D. Demetrio), la rhétorique (U. Eco), la philosophie du récit (P. Ricœur) et la pédagogie concernant l’éducation des adultes (andragogie). Au long de la phase dogmatique de la recherche se déployant dans la première et la deuxième partie, le débat théologique sur la dimension narrative de la Révélation divine s’enrichit des apports de théologiens importants, tels H.-U. von Balthasar, E. Jüngel, J. Ratzinger, Y. Congar et C. Theobald. À l’intérieur de la thèse, un précieux chapitre est consacré entièrement à une analyse du Petit Prince d’Antoine de Saint-Exupéry menée sur un registre autobiographique à proprement parler, et appliquant, de manière originale, les trois mimèsis de la philosophie du récit de P. Ricœur. Enfin, dans la troisième partie, constituant le moment pastoral de la recherche, l’auteur envisage le thème de l’évangélisation. Ici, avant de déboucher sur la proposition du « Cénacle autobiographique », il reporte, telle une petite « autobiographie intellectuelle », l’interview d’A. Binz, un ancien professeur suisse de théologie pastorale et de pédagogie religieuse des adultes, et pionnier en Europe de l’approche autobiographique en pastorale. Couronnement pragmatique de sa recherche-action, les « cénacles » ou cercles autobiographiques attestent l’expérience de Massimiliano Scalici avec des personnes adultes appartenant à trois milieux sociaux et ecclésiaux différents : fidèles d’une paroisse, agents pastoraux engagés dans la Caritas d’un diocèse et personnes détenues. Les ateliers autobiographiques, rapportés au dernier chapitre, témoignent de l’implication marquante des « cenacolisti » (les participants aux cercles autobiographiques) et des avantages formatifs, thérapeutiques et performatifs dégagés par la méthode autobiographique relativement à l’aspect anthropologique et pédagogique de la foi chrétienne et de l’annonce. Car, finalement, à l’intérieur de ces cénacles, jouant sur les langages autobiographiques et synesthésiques, l’unique Évangile que le Seigneur, en plus de le confier aux apôtres et aux évangélistes, a inscrit également dans les cœurs mêmes des hommes, jaillit sous un autre mode, proprement le mode analogique qu’est le « troisième Testament ».",10.24894/978-3-7965-4357-9,2021-05-08,www.schwabeonline.ch,Schwabe eLibrary

Single and dimer nanoantennas are fabricated by slicing III-V semiconductor nanowires with focused ion beam milling. The nonlinear optical response of nanoantennas is tailored by adjusting their length and position to achieve a targeted phase difference. The studied GaAs nanoantennas have a wurtzite structure that allows to achieve preferable directions for the second‐harmonic emission compared to a typical bulk zinc blende structure from top‐down fabricated nanostructures. Wurtzite nanoantennas provide a pure electric dipole response at the second‐harmonic wavelength, which together with pi‐phase control of emitted light is used for designing nonlinear emission patterns. The simulation results show how to redirect the second‐harmonic beam up to 30° and how to tailor the emission profile by adding elements. This method of second‐harmonic generation manipulation and phase array engineering can be applied to different types of nanowires and nanostructures. Nonlinear beam steering with structures from nanowires will foster the creation of compact optical components for integrated circuits.",10.1002/lpor.202000028,2020-09-20,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/429144,ETH server

Can a prompt to generate alternative diagnoses (prompt) or a differential diagnosis checklist (DDXC) increase diagnostic accuracy? How do these interventions affect the diagnostic process and self-monitoring?Methods Advanced medical students (N = 90) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions to complete six computer-based patient cases: Group 1 (prompt) was instructed to write down all diagnoses they considered while acquiring diagnostic test results, and to finally rank them. Groups 2 and 3 received the same instruction plus a list of 17 differential diagnoses for the chief complaint of the patient. For half of the cases, the DDXC contained the correct diagnosis (DDXC+) and for the other half, it did not (DDXC-; counterbalanced). Group 4 (control) was only instructed to indicate their final diagnosis. Mixed-effects models were used to analyze results.Results Students using a DDXC that contained the correct diagnosis had better diagnostic accuracy, mean (standard deviation), 0.75 (0.44), compared to controls without a checklist, 0.49 (0.50), P < 0.001, but those using a DDXC that did not contain the correct diagnosis did slightly worse, 0.43 (0.50), P = 0.602. The number and relevance of diagnostic tests acquired were not affected by condition, nor was self-monitoring. However, participants spent more time on a case in the DDXC-, 4:20 minutes (2:36), P ≤ 0.001, and DDXC+ condition, 3:52 minutes (2:09), than in the control condition, 2:59 minutes (1:44), P ≤ 0.001.Discussion Being provided a list of possible diagnoses improves diagnostic accuracy compared with a prompt to create a differential diagnosis list, if the provided list contains the correct diagnosis. However, being provided a diagnosis list without the correct diagnosis did not improve and might have slightly reduced diagnostic accuracy.

General context of the data set ""LUSzoning”; 2. Background and aims of the study using the data set LUSzoning; 3. The data set LUSzoning. ###1. General context of the data set ""LUSzoning"". The data set ""LUSzoning"" stands for Land-use simulations integrating zoning regulations in Spanish functional urban areas. The data set has been generated as part of the CONCUR research project (https://www.wsl.ch/en/projects/concur.html) led by Dr. Anna M. Hersperger and funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (ERC TBS Consolidator Grant (ID: BSCGIO 157789) for the period 2016-2021. The CONCUR research project is interdisciplinary and aims to develop a scientific basis for adequately integrating spatial policies (in this case, digital zoning plans) into quantitative land-change modelling approaches at the urban regional level. ###2. Background and aims of the study using the data set “LUSzoning”. As part of the CONCUR project, a specific task was to integrate planning spatial policies in land-change modelling. Planning can be implemented in modelling using either hard or gradual restrictions. Different studies have addressed the inclusion of spatial planning policies in land-use change modelling. However, the integration of zoning constraints is generally established as hard or Boolean-based restrictions (e.g., whether urban development is allowed or not), while not accounting for the spatial heterogeneity or gradual characteristics within planning zones (e.g., whether planning regulations allow low, medium or high urban density), though these could improve real patterns simulations in urban areas. We assume Spanish General Zoning plans were suitable to explore the integration of planning into land-change modelling as soft constrains because they define land-use intensities in the buildable zoning areas. In light of the above considerations, the overall aim of the study was to model urban land-use changes using a multi-scenario approach that integrates digitized zoning plans for the Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) of Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Zaragoza. The following specific objectives were addressed: i) to analyse the role of planning by defining three future scenarios that integrate digitized zoning plans and one scenario that assumes almost no planning intervention; ii) to introduce zoning constraints that reflect different degrees of urban densities; iii) to generate a transferable spatially-explicit modelling framework to integrate planning into land-use change simulations. Four future land-use demands scenarios were defined for the FUAs. Storylines were created considering probable development scenarios related to zoning plans, current Spanish legislation and sustainability goals defined along two axes: a high market-oriented vs. high planning-intervention axis, and an axis of short-term economic growth vs. long-term sustainable growth. The sustainable development scenario (S1) is characterized by low gross floor area (GFA) growth that is limited to areas that are currently under development according to zoning plans. The business-as-usual scenario (S2) is characterized by medium GFA growth in the range of on-going trends. The strong development scenario (S3) is characterized by high GFA growth rates. Growth is restricted to buildable areas without urbanization project designated in zoning plans. The unrestricted development scenario (S4) prioritizes a high degree of market liberalization characterized by high GFA growth that surpasses population demands. S4 follows a rapid economic growth pattern with almost no planning intervention. ###3. The data set “LUSzoning”. The dataset includes 16 .asc raster layers providing the simulated land-uses under four defined scenarios for Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Zaragoza Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) for 2030. The simulated raster layers were created using CLUMondo simulation framework and have a spatial resolution of 30m. The .asc layers name include the name of the FUA and scenario number. For example, the output from simulating the urban growth for the city of Zaragoza under Scenario 2 is named “Zaragoza_S2.tif”.

R., & Hersperger, A. M. (2020). Spatial plans as relational data: Using social network analysis to assess consistency among Bucharest’s planning instruments. Land Use Policy, 92. The goal of this paper was to first develop a theoretical framework for external consistency assessment in spatial plans and then to test the framework with ten spatial plans of the Bucharest (Romania) region. Specifically, the paper has the following workflow: (i) to develop a framework for consistency assessment covering four categories of external consistency; (ii) to extract relevant plan statements from all plans on the four categories; (iii) to assign one-way, symmetrical and contradictory relationships between the extracted plan statements; and (iv) to assess consistencies, inconsistencies and contradictions between plans using directed and valued network analyses. All results were then validated by applying questionnaires to local experts. The study focuses on a sample consisting of 10 spatial plans of Bucharest that: (1) are currently in force, (2) have spatial implications, (3) involve different administrative levels and (4) come from different planning sectors. The list of the reviewed planning documents can be found in Table 2 of the paper. The framework of consistency assessment contains 24 items, which can be found in Table 1 of the paper. All planning documents were read in respect to all items of the framework in order to extract plan statements used in the analysis. As a result, we provide the plan statement extracted from 10 plans on the 24 items of the framework. All data is in Romanian. The data was discussed qualitatively in the research paper.",10.16904/envidat.290,2022-02-09,https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/plan-statements-for-external-consistency-analysis,envidat

(2021). Deriving Planning Intentions from written planning documents. Report on CONCUR Project- From plans to land change: how strategic spatial planning contributes to the development of urban regions. The data corresponds to the data collected as part of the DPI Method for deriving all PIs contained in a plan (open coding) as detailed in section 4 of the report. The method involved reading the plans to break down of information in meaningful discrete “incidents” or planning intentions. To identify the planning intentions, the starting points were represented by a) the structuring of the plans in chapters and sub chapters and b) the themes that the plans addressed. Thus, the collected information was not grouped according to pre-defined categories of planning intentions, but rather put together as a list of intentions as revealed by each plan. As a result, we provide, for each case study, a document (named [Urban region name] PI as defined in the plan) which contains:  Date when the information was filled in.  Name of the urban region and analysed strategic spatial plan .  A list of all planning intentions contained in a plan, with each PI being addresses as follows:  Name of PI as it appears in the plan  Translated name of the PI (i.e. short name for easy understanding of the meaning)  Explanation regarding the meaning of the PI  Why the PI is considered a priority for the urban region  Spatial information on the PI (text and cartographic representations). In total, 14 documents are available, one for each case study.

It is usually taken for granted that a pair of colliding Weyl points annihilate whenever they carry opposite chiral charges. In stark contrast, here we report that Weyl points in systems symmetric under the composition of time-reversal with a π-rotation are characterized by a non-Abelian topological invariant. The topological charges of the Weyl points are transformed via braid phase factors which arise upon exchange inside symmetric planes of the reciprocal momentum space. We elucidate this process with an elementary two-dimensional tight-binding model implementable in cold-atoms setups and in photonic systems. In three dimensions, interplay of the non-Abelian topology with point-group symmetry is shown to enable topological phase transitions in which pairs of Weyl points may scatter or convert into nodal-line rings. By combining our theoretical arguments with first-principles calculations, we predict that Weyl points occurring near the Fermi level of zirconium telluride (ZrTe) carry non-trivial values of the non-Abelian charge, and that uniaxial compression strain drives a non-trivial conversion of the Weyl points into nodal lines.",https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:vb-mk,2020-06-09,https://doi.org/10.24435/materialscloud:vb-mk,Materials Cloud

Characterizing the 3-D urban morphology transformation to understand urban-form dynamics: a case study of Austin, Texas, USA. Landscape and urban planning, 2020, 203:103881. The overall objective of this paper is to understand urban form dynamics in the Austin metropolitan area for the periods 2006-2011 and 2011-2016. The study also aims to understand to what extent the changes in the built environment (in terms of ‘efficient growth’ versus ‘inefficient growth’) from the 1990s to 2016 in the Austin metropolitan area corresponded with ‘compact and efficient growth’ planning policy documents. The UMT distribution can be found in the paper. The area of transitioning UMT was provided in Table 2 and Table 3 can be found in the Appendix of the paper. A protocol was developed to perform the content analysis of the strategic plans and gather the data. The detailed list of protocol items can be found in Appendix B of the paper. This study demonstrates the advantage of applying Lidar data to characterize 3-D urban morphology type (UMT) transition and understand its dynamics, which helps develop a comprehensive understanding of the urbanization process and provides a tool for planning intentions and policies evaluation on urban development over time. The UMT maps can be found in Appendix A of the paper. The Lidar point datasets and the 30 × 30 m National Land Cover Database (NLCD) are the two main data sources of UMT mapping. Lidar datasets were gathered from different projects that had been conducted and collected by state agencies and other organizations between 2007 and 2017.

In this work, we evaluated the conformance of stated spatial planning goals and the outcomes in terms of urban compactness, basic services and housing provision, and nature conservation for different land-use strategies. We evaluate the 2005 Ecological-Economic Zoning (EEZ) and two municipal master plans from 2006 in a coastal region in São Paulo State, Brazil. We used Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM) to explain the relationship between the plan strategies and land-use change ten years after implementation in terms of urban compactness, basic services and housing increase, and nature conservation.We acquired the data for the explanatory variables from different sources listed on Table 1. Since the model is spatially explicit, all input data were transformed to a 30 m resolution raster. Regarding the evaluated spatial plans, we acquired the zones limits from the São Paulo State Environmental Planning Division (CPLA-SP), Ilhabela and Ubatuba municipality.    Land use and cover data: Urban persistence, Urban axial, Urban infill, Urban Isolates, Forest cover persistence, Forest cover gain, NDVI increaseWe acquired two Landsat Collection 1 Higher-Level Surface Reflectance images distributed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), covering the entire study area (paths 76 and 77, row 220, WRS-2 reference system, https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). We classified one image acquired by the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on 2005-05-150, and one image from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor from 2015-08-15. We collected 100 samples for forest cover, 100 samples for built-up cover and 100 samples for other classes. We then classified these three classes of land cover at each image date using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised algorithm (Hsu et al., 2003), using ENVI 5.0 software.Land-use and land-cover changes from 2005 to 2015 were quantified using map algebra, by mathematically adding them together in pairs (10*LULC2015 + LULC2005). We reclassified the LULC data into forest gain (conversion of any 2005 LULC to forest cover in 2015); forest persistence (2005 forested pixels that remained forested in 2015); new built-up area (conversion of any 2005 LULC to built-up in 2015); and urban maintenance (2005 built-up pixels that remained built-up in 2015).To describe the spatial configuration of the urban expansion, we classified the new built-up areas into axial, infill and isolated, following Inostroza et al. (2013) (For details, please refer to Supplementary Material I at the original publication).The NDVI was obtained from the same source used for the LULC data. With the Google Engine platform, we used an annual average for the best pixels (without clouds) for 2005 and 2015, and we calculated the changes between dates. We used increases of > 0.2 NDVI to represent an improvement in forest quality.    Federal Census data organization: Urban Basic Services and Housing indicator, socioeconomic and population:The data used to infer the values of basic services provision, socioeconomic and population drivers was derived from the Brazilian National Census data (IBGE, 2000 and 2010). Population density, permanent housing unit density, mean income, basic education, and the percentage of houses receiving waste collection, sanitation and water provision services, called basic services in the context of this study, were calculated per 30 m pixel. The Human Development Index is only available at the municipality level. We attributed the HDI for the vector file with the municipality border, and we rasterized (30 m resolution) this file in QGIS. Annual rates of change were then calculated to allow comparability between LULC periods. To infer the BSH, we used only areas with an increase in permanent housing density and basic services provision (See Supplementary Material I at the original publication).    Topographic driversTo infer the values of the topographic driver, we used the slope data and the Topographic Index Position (TPI) based on the digital elevation model from SRTM (30 m resolution) produced by ALOS (freely available at eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/about/about_index.htm), and both variables were considered constant from 2005 to 2015 (See Supplementary Material I at the original publication).",https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/spatial-planning-brazil,2022-01-06,https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/spatial-planning-brazil,envidat

In microbes, an important mechanism of HGT is prophage acquisition (phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes). Prophages can influence bacterial fitness via transfer of beneficial genes (including antibiotic-resistance genes, ARGs), protection from superinfecting phages, or switching to a lytic lifecycle which releases free phages infectious to competitors. We expect these effects to depend on environmental conditions because of, for example, environment-dependent induction of the lytic lifecycle. However, it remains unclear how costs/benefits of prophages vary across environments. Here, studying prophages with/without ARGs in Escherichia coli, we disentangled effects of prophages alone and adaptive genes they carry. In competition with prophage-free strains, benefits from prophages and ARGs peaked in different environments. Prophages were most beneficial when induction of the lytic lifecycle was common, whereas ARGs were more beneficial upon antibiotic exposure and with reduced prophage induction. Acquisition of prophage-encoded ARGs by competing strains was most common when prophage induction, and therefore free phages, were common. Thus, selection on prophages and adaptive genes they carry varies independently across environments, which is important for predicting the spread of mobile/integrating genetic elements and their role in evolution",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dfn2z350c,2020-12-17,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.dfn2z350c,dryad

Methane oxidizing bacteria in the water column act as a converter, oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide and biomass before it reaches the atmosphere. Current observations and estimates of this methane oxidation efficiency are diverging, especially for the lake overturn period. Here we combine a model of turbulent mixing, gas exchange and microbial growth with a comprehensive data set for autumn mixing to quantify the relevant physical and microbial processes. We show that the microbial methane converter is effectively transforming the increased methane flux during the overturn period. Only rare events of pronounced surface cooling in combination with persistently strong wind can trigger substantial outgassing. In the context of climate change, these results suggest that changes in the frequency of storms may be even more important for methane emissions from temperate lakes than gradual warming.",DOI: 10.3929/ethz-b-000350091,2019-09-27,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/350091,Research Collection ETHZ

To understand this process in an evolutionary context, we investigate postnatal ontogenetic changes in the skulls of crown bird and non-avian theropods using anatomical network analysis (AnNA). Due to the greater number of bones and bone contacts, early juvenile crown birds have less integrated skulls, resembling their non-avian theropod ancestors, including Archaeopteryx lithographica and Ichthyornis dispars. Phylogenetic comparisons indicate that skull bone fusion and the resulting modular integration represent a peramorphosis (developmental exaggeration of the ancestral adult trait) that evolved late during avialan evolution, at the origin of crown-birds. Succeeding the general paedomorphic shape trend, the occurrence of an additional peramorphosis reflects the mosaic complexity of the avian skull evolution.",10.1038/s42003-020-0914-4,2020-12-24,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0914-4#Sec11,Communications Biology

For some metrics such as Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures, there is remarkable agreement between models and reconstructions. For other diagnostics, such as the regional response to volcanic eruptions, or hemispheric temperature differences, substantial disagreements between data and models have been reported. Here, we assess the potential sources of these discrepancies by comparing 1000-year hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on real-world paleoclimate proxies with climate-model-based pseudoproxies. These pseudoproxy experiments (PPE) indicate that noise inherent in proxy records and the unequal spatial distribution of proxy data are the key factors in explaining the data-model differences. For example, lower inter-hemispheric correlations in reconstructions can be fully accounted for by these factors in the PPE. Noise and data sampling also partly explain the reduced amplitude of the response to external forcing in reconstructions compared to models. For other metrics, such as inter-hemispheric differences, some, although reduced, discrepancy remains. Our results suggest that improving proxy data quality and spatial coverage is the key factor to increase the quality of future climate reconstructions, while the total number of proxy records and reconstruction methodology play a smaller role.",https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23890,2018-12-31,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23890,NOAA paleoclimate database

The goal of this research was to review recent publications to assess the use of landscape ecological concepts in planning. Specifically, we address the following research questions: Q1. Landscape ecological concepts: What are they? How frequently are they mentioned in current research? Q2. How are landscape ecological concepts integrated in landscape planning?We analysed all empirical and overview papers that have been published in four key academic journals in the field of landscape ecology and landscape planning in the years 2015-2019 (n = 1918). Four key journals in the field of landscape ecology were selected to conduct the analysis, respectively Landscape Ecology (LE), Landscape Online (LO), Current Landscape Ecology Reports (CLER), and Landscape and Urban Planning (LUP). The title, abstract and keywords of all papers were read in order to identify landscape ecological concepts. Then, all 1918 papers went through a keyword search to identify the use of early and additional concepts. We used the “pdfsearch” package in R programming language and searched for singular and plural forms and different variations of the concepts (see Supplementary material 1, Table A). As a result, we provided four outputs:  1. Frequency of early concepts. This data provides the total number of times each article used each early concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 2a at the original publication.  2. Frequency of additional concepts. This data provides the total number of times each article used each additional concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 2b at the original publication.  3. Use of any early concept. This data provides the total number of times each article used any early concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 3a at the original publication.  4. Use of any additional concept. This data provides the total number of times each article used any additional concept (Q1). This data was used to produce the Figure 3b at the original publication.To address the second question (Q2), the title, abstract and keywords of the papers included in our sample (n=1918 articles) were screened to identify papers that might show how landscape ecological concepts are integrated into planning. We selected 52 empirical papers (see Supplementary material - 4 Integration of landscape ecological concepts into planning), and we provided two outputs:  5. Planning steps.

The proxy records are from trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, documentary evidence, and other archives. They range in length from 50 to 2000 years, with a median of 547 years, while temporal resolution ranges from biweekly to centennial.

Here, we assess the stationarity of SAM spatial correlations with instrumental and paleoclimate proxy data for the past millennium. The instrumental period shows that temporal non-stationarities in SAM teleconnections are not consistent across the SH land areas. This suggests that the influence of the SAM index is modulated by regional effects. However, within key-regions with good proxy data coverage (South America, Tasmania, New Zealand), teleconnections are mostly stationary over the instrumental period. Using different stationarity criteria for proxy record selection, we provide new austral summer and annual mean SAM index reconstructions over the last millennium. Our summer SAM reconstructions are very robust to changes in proxy record selection and the selection of the calibration period, particularly on the multi-decadal timescale. In contrast, the weaker performance and lower agreement in the annual mean SAM reconstructions point towards changing teleconnection patterns that may be particularly important outside the summer months. Our results clearly portend that the temporal stationarity of the proxy-climate relationships should be taken into account in the design of comprehensive regional and hemispherical climate reconstructions. The summer SAM reconstructions show no significant relationship to solar, greenhouse gas and volcanic forcing, with the exception of an extremely strong negative anomaly following the AD 1257 Samalas eruption. Furthermore, reconstructed pre-industrial summer SAM trends are very similar to trends obtained by model control simulations. We find that recent trends in the summer SAM lie outside the 5-95% range of pre-industrial natural variability.",https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23130,2018-12-31,https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/23130,NOAA paleoclimate database

Here we describe a new, non-archaeopterygid avialan from the Lower Tithonian Mörnsheim Formation of the Solnhofen Archipelago, Alcmonavis poeschli gen. et sp. nov. Represented by a right wing, Alcmonavis shows several derived characters, including a pronounced attachment for the pectoralis muscle, a pronounced tuberculum bicipitale radii, and a robust second manual digit, indicating that it is a more derived avialan than Archaeopteryx. Several modifications, especially in muscle attachments of muscles that in modern birds are related to the downstroke of the wing, indicate an increased adaptation of the forelimb for active flapping flight in the early evolution of birds. This discovery indicates higher avialan diversity in the Late Jurassic than previously recognized.",https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43789.027,2019-05-14,https://elifesciences.org/articles/43789/figures#files,eLife

Background and aims of the study using the data set lsUDPs; 3. The data set lsUDPs: 3.1 Selection of cases and data collection; 3.2 Data management and operationalisation    General context of the data set ""lsUDPs"" The data set ""lsUDPs"" has been generated as part of the CONCUR research project (https://www.wsl.ch/en/projects/concur.html) led by Dr. Anna M. Hersperger and funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (ERC TBS Consolidator Grant (ID: BSCGIO 157789) for the period 2016-2020. The CONCUR research project is interdisciplinary and aims to develop a scientific basis for adequately integrating spatial policies (in this case, strategic spatial plans) into quantitative land-change modelling approaches at the urban regional level. The first stage (2016-2017) of the CONCUR project focussed on 21 urban regions in Western Europe. The urban regions were selected through a multi-stage strategy for empirical research (see Hersperger, A. M., Grădinaru, S., Oliveira, E., Pagliarin, S., & Palka, G. (2019). Understanding strategic spatial planning to effectively guide development of urban regions. Cities, 94, 96-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.032 ).    Background and aims of the study using the data set lsUDPs As part of the CONCUR project, a specific task was to examine the relationship between strategic spatial plans and the formulation and implementation (i.e. urban land change) of large-scale urban development projects in Western Europe. Strategic urban projects are typically large-scale, prominent urban transformations implemented locally with the aim to stimulate urban growth, for instance in the form of urban renewals of deprived neighborhoods, waterfront renewals and transport infrastructures. While strategic urban projects are referred to in the literature with multiple terms, in the CONCOR project we call them large-scale urban development projects (lsUDPs). Previous studies acknowledged both local and supra-local (or structural) factors impacting the context-specific implementation of lsUDPs. Local governance factors, such as institutional capacity, coordination among public and private actors and political leadership, intertwine with supra-local conditions, such as state re-scaling processes and devolution of state competencies in spatial planning, de-industrialisation and increasing social inequality. Hence, in implementing lsUDPs, multi-scalar factors act in combination. Because the formulation and implementation of lsUDPs require multi-scalar coordination among coalitions of public and private actors over an extended period of time, they are generally linked to strategic spatial plans (SSPs). Strategic spatial plans convey collective visions and horizons of action negotiated among public and private actors at the local and/or regional level to steer future urban development, and can contain legally binding dispositions, but also indicative guidelines. The key question remains as to what extent large-scale urban development projects and strategic spatial plans can be regarded as aligned. By alignment, or “concordance”, we mean that strategic projects are formulated and implemented as part of the strategic planning process (“high concordance”), or that the strategic role of projects is reconfirmed in (subsequent) strategic plans (“moderate concordance”). Lack of concordance is found when lsUDPs have been limitedly (or not at all) acknowledged in strategic spatial plans. We assume that certain local and supra-local factors, characterising the development of the projects, foster (but not strictly “cause”) the degree of alignment between lsUPDs and SSPs. In this study, we empirically examine how, and to what extent, the concordance between 38 European large-scale urban development projects and strategic plans (outcome: CONCOR) has been enabled by five multi-scalar factors (or conditions): (i) the role of the national state (STATE), (ii) the role of (inter)national private actors (PRIVATE), (iii) the occurrence of supra-regional external events (EVENTS), (iv) the degree of transport connectivity (TRANSP), and (v) local resistance from civil society (RESIST). We adopted a (multi-data) case-based qualitative strategy for empirical research and applied the formalised procedure of within- and cross-case comparison offered by fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis appropriate for the goal of this study. Based on set theory, QCA formally integrates contextual sensitivity to case specificities (within-case knowledge) with systematic comparative analysis (across-case knowledge). The research question the data set has been created to reply to is the following: which conditions, and combinations of conditions, enable the concordance between large-scale urban development projects and strategic spatial plans? The conditions (“independent variables”) considered are. STATE: the set of large-scale urban projects characterized by a high degree of state intervention and support in their formulation and implementation, PRIVATE: the set of large-scale urban projects characterized by a high degree of involvement of (inter)national private actors in their formulation and implementation, EVENTS: the set of large-scale strategic projects whose formulation and implementation have been strongly affected by unforeseen international events and/or global trends, TRANSP: the set of large-scale strategic projects with a high degree of road and/or transit connectivity, and RESIST: set of large-scale strategic projects whose realization has been characterized by resistances that have substantially delayed or modified the project implementation. The outcome (“dependent variable”) under analysis is CONCOR: the set of large-scale urban projects having a high degree of concordance/alignment/integration with strategic spatial plans    The data set lsUDPs    3.1 Selection of cases and data collection To generate the current data set on large-scale urban development projects in European urban regions (data set ""lsUDPs""), we identified 35 large-scale urban development projects in a sample of the 21 Western urban regions considered in the CONCUR project (see supra, Hersperger et al. 2019): Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lyon, Manchester, Milan, Stockholm, Stuttgart. The criteria we followed to identify the 35 large-scale urban development projects are: geographical location, size (large-scale), site (located either in the city core or in the larger urban region) and urban function (e.g. housing, transportation infrastructures, service and knowledge economic functions). Employing these criteria facilitated the selection of diverse large-scale urban development projects while still ensuring sufficient comparability. In 2016, we performed 47 in-depth interviews with experts in urban and regional planning and large-scale strategic projects and infrastructure (i.e. academics and practitioners) about the formulation, implementation and development (1990s-2010s) of each project in each of the 9 selected urban regions. On average, each interviewee answered questions on 3.1 large-scale urban development projects. Three cases were subdivided into two cases because a clear differentiation between specific implementation stages was identified by the interviewees (expansion of the Barcelona airport, cases “bcn_airport80-90” and “bcn_airport00-16”; realisation of Lyon Part-Dieu, cases “lyo_partdieu70-90” and “lyo_partdieu00-16”; MediaCityUK, cases “man_salfordquays80-00” and “man_mediacityuk00-16”). Therefore, from the initial 35 cases, the final number of analysed cases in the lsUDPs dataset is 38.    3.2 The data set lsUDPs: Data management and operationalisationInterviews were fully transcribed and analysed through MAXQDA (version 12.3, VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany), and intercoder agreement was evaluated on a sample of nine interviews. We also compiled “synthetic case descriptions” (SCD) for each case (totalling more than 160 SCDs) to spot potential inconsistencies among interviewees’ accounts and to facilitate completion of the “calibration table” for each case (see below). An online expert survey distributed to the interviewees (response rate 78%) helped systematise the information collected during the interviews. We also consulted both academic and gray literature on the case studies to check for possible ambiguity and inconsistencies in the interview data, and to solve discrepancies between our assigned set membership scores and questionnaire values. Site visits were also carried out to retrieve additional information on the selected cases. For each case (i.e. each of the 38 selected large-scale urban development projects), we operationalised each condition (i.e. STATE, PRIVATE, EVENTS, TRANSP, RESIST) and the outcome (CONCOR) in terms of sets, for subsequent application of Qualitative Comparative Analysis. This process is called “calibration”; we used a number of indicators for each condition to qualitatively assess each large-scale project across the conditions. The case-based qualitative assessment was then transformed into fuzzy-set membership values. Fuzzy-set membership values range from 0 to 1, and should be conceived as “fundamentally interpretative tools” that “operationalize theoretical concepts in a way that enhances the dialogue between ideas and evidence” (Ragin 2000:162, in “Fuzzy-set Social Science”. Chicago: University Press). We employed a four-value fuzzy-set scale (0, 0.33, 0.67, 1) to “quantify” into set membership scores the individual histories of cases retrieved from interview data. Only the condition TRANSP was calibrated as a crisp-set (0, 1). The translation of qualitative case-based information into numerical fuzzy-set membership values was iteratively performed by populating a calibration table following standard practices recently emerged in QCA when dealing with qualitative (interview) data.",10.16904/envidat.89,2019-08-22,https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/large-scale-urban-development-projects-in-european-urban-regions,envidat

The specificity of presynaptic and postsynaptic interactions that is presumably mediated by cell adhesion molecules suggests that there exists a logic that could explain neuronal connectivity at the molecular level. Despite its importance, however, the nature of such logic is poorly understood, and even basic parameters, such as the number, identity, and single-cell expression profiles of candidate synaptic cell adhesion molecules, are not known. Here, we devised a comprehensive list of genes involved in cell adhesion, and used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze their expression in electrophysiologically defined interneurons and projection neurons. We compared the cell type-specific expression of these genes with that of genes involved in transmembrane ion conductances (i.e., channels), exocytosis, and rho/rac signaling, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Using these data, we identified two independent, developmentally regulated networks of interacting genes encoding molecules involved in cell adhesion, exocytosis, and signal transduction. Our approach provides a framework for a presumed cell adhesion and signaling code in neurons, enables correlating electrophysiological with molecular properties of neurons, and suggests avenues toward understanding synaptic specificity.",GSE75386,2016-08-30,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE75386,Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

Recent large-scale transcriptomic assays seem to confirm this hypothesis, but a lack of morphological information has limited the identification of several known cell types. In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq in morphologically identified parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), and studied their transcriptomic states in the morphological, physiological, and developmental domains. Overall, we find high transcriptomic similarity among PV-INs, with few genes showing divergent expression between morphologically different types. Furthermore, PV-INs show a uniform synaptic cell adhesion molecule (CAM) profile, suggesting that CAM expression in mature PV cells does not reflect wiring specificity after development. Together, our results suggest that while PV-INs differ in anatomy and in vivo activity, their continuous transcriptomic and homogenous biophysical landscapes are not predictive of these distinct identities.",GSE142546,2021-12-04,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE142546,NCBI GEO

We found two firing phenotypes of CCK+INs in rat hippocampal CA3 area; either possessing a previously undetected membrane potential-dependent firing or regular firing phenotype, due to different low-voltage-activated potassium currents. These different excitability properties destine the two types for distinct functions, because the former is essentially silenced during realistic 8-15 Hz oscillations. By contrast, the general intrinsic excitability, morphology and gene-profiles of the two types were surprisingly similar. Even the expression of Kv4.3 channels were comparable, despite evidences showing that Kv4.3-mediated currents underlie the distinct firing properties. Instead, the firing phenotypes were correlated with the presence of distinct isoforms of Kv4 auxiliary subunits (KChIP1 vs. KChIP4e and DPP6S). Our results reveal the underlying mechanisms of two previously unknown types of CCK+INs and demonstrate that alternative splicing of few genes, which may be viewed as a minor change in the cells’ whole transcriptome, can determine cell-type identity.",GSE133951,2020-06-03,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133951,NCBI GEO

Growth conditions and materials are reported in the relative publication. OCT scans at two lateral resolutions (40 um, 40 um, 2.18 um x,y,z respectivey) and (11.1 um ,11.1 um and 2.18 um) were taken every 3 days in a 15 days experiment. 66 x 3 low resolution (LR) scans covered an area of 0.4 m x 0.025 m in a tiled pattern. 3 x 3 high resolution (HR) scans were taken at the extremes of the same area of interest. These are labeled as slow-flow morphotype (SFM, or B5) and and fast-flow morphotype (FFM, or B1), to indicate the respective contrasting flow velocity conditions. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Authomated OCT scans acquisition was done with the system descibed in (Depetris et al. 2019, Automated 3D Optical Coherence Tomography to Elucidate Biofilm Morphogenesis Over Large Spatial Scales, JoVE, 10.3791/59356). The 'raw OCT scans' folder contains all the raw OCT scans, as well as some samples of OCT scans corrected for spherical aberrations. OCT scans were processed to obtain a 2D map of the biofilm surface topology, in which each pixel gray-level encodes the biofilm height; these are termed digital elevation models (DEM). DEMs were then stitched in a unique image and stacked into time-series; these are in the 'DEMs' folder. Around day 15, several oxygen concentration depth profiles were measured within and around structures of the SFM and FFM (just for replicate II).

Yet, general theoretical concepts of fitness are often hard to translate into quantities that can be measured in wild populations experiencing complex environmental, demographic, genetic and selective variation. While the ‘fittest’ entities might be widely understood to be those that ultimately leave most descendants at some future time, such long-term legacies can rarely be measured, impeding evaluation of the degree to which tractable short-term metrics of individual fitness could potentially serve as useful direct proxies. One opportunity for conceptual and empirical convergence stems from the principle of individual reproductive value (Vi), defined as the number of copies of each of an individual’s alleles that is expected to be present in future generations given the individual’s realised pedigree of descendants. Since Vi tightly predicts an individual’s longer-term genetic contribution, quantifying Vi provides a tractable route to quantifying what, to date, has been an abstract theoretical fitness concept. We used complete pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to demonstrate that individuals’ expected genetic contributions stabilise within an observed 20-year (i.e. ~8 generation) time period, allowing estimation of individual Vi. Considerable among-individual variation in Vi was evident in both sexes. Standard metrics of individual lifetime fitness, comprising lifespan, lifetime reproductive success and projected growth rate, typically explained less than half the variation. We thereby elucidate the degree to which fitness metrics observed on individuals concur with measures of longer-term genetic contributions, and consider the degree to which analyses of pedigree structure could provide useful complementary insights into evolutionary outcomes.",10.5061/dryad.cf388r6,,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.cf388r6,Dryad

Il s’agit de l’Historia del Huérfano, por Andrés de León, un livre qui narre à la troisième personne les aventures (et mésaventures) d’un jeune homme désigné comme « l’Orphelin ». Né en Espagne, le personnage voyage en Amérique à l’âge de quatorze ans. Il y prend l’habit religieux dans un couvent augustin, mais une série de péripéties l’oblige à voyager (parfois sous le déguisement d’un soldat) à travers une grande partie des territoires appartenant à la couronne espagnole, tant en Amérique qu’en Europe. Le texte, qui s’étend sur 328 folios, est accompagné de plus de septante poèmes que l’Orphelin aurait écrits de sa main, offrant un témoignage sans précédent de l’effervescence de l’activité poétique dans les colonies hispaniques. Or, malgré son importance, l’œuvre demeurait méconnue des chercheurs (et du grand public) et des questions importantes, telles que l’attribution du manuscrit et le genre du texte, restaient encore à élucider. Ce volume propose une édition critique du texte, dotée d’un appareil de notes rigoureux qui rend compte de toutes les informations (notamment de type linguistique ou historique) qui pourraient éclairer le lecteur contemporain. Cette édition est accompagnée d’une étude préliminaire où nous avons confirmé les hypothèses lancées par de précédents chercheurs quant à l’identité de l’auteur, qui s’avère être bel et bien Martín de León y Cárdenas, frère augustin espagnol. Elle recueille aussi un grand nombre de cas d’intertextualités et de prêts entre notre manuscrit et d’autres œuvres de l’époque (indiqués également dans l’édition sous forme de notes). En effet, nos recherches nous ont permis de découvrir que la narration est construite comme un collage nourri d’ouvrages divers, historiques et littéraires, que l’auteur a superposés et modifiés afin de créer un nouveau produit en l’articulant autour de la présence de l’Orphelin. Enfin, nous présentons les indices qui nous ont conduite à établir que le texte n’était pas tant le récit de la vie d’un homme (comme suggéré jusqu’alors par la critique, qui doutait de la classification du manuscrit en tant que biographie ou autobiographie), mais une œuvre de fiction qui vise à dénoncer de façon voilée la faiblesse croissante de l’empire espagnol des deux côtés de l’Atlantique.",https://hdl.handle.net/10171/59435,2020-10-19,https://dadun.unav.edu/handle/10171/59435,Dadun

The South American Native Ungulates (SANUs) exhibited high taxonomical, morphological, and ecological diversity and were widely distributed on the continent. However, most SANU fossil records come from high latitudes. This sampling bias challenges the study of their diversity dynamics and biogeography during important tectonic and biotic events, such as the Great American Biotic Interchange, the faunal exchange between North and South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. We describe new SANU remains from the Neogene of the Cocinetas (northern Colombia) and Falcon (northwestern Venezuela) Basins. In the Cocinetas Basin, the middle Miocene fauna of the Castilletes Formation includes Hilarcotherium miyou sp. nov. (Astrapotheriidae), cf. Huilatherium (Leontiniidae), and Lambdaconus cf. L. colombianus (Proterotheriidae). The late Pliocene fauna of the Ware Formation includes a Toxodontinae indet. and the putative oldest record of Camelidae in South America. In the Falcon Basin, the Pliocene/Pleistocene faunas of the Codore and San Gregorio Formations include Falcontoxodon aguilerai gen. et sp. nov. and Proterotheriidae indet. We provide a phylogenetic analysis for Astrapotheriidae and Toxodontidae. The new data document a low-latitude provinciality within some SANU clades (e.g., Astrapotheriidae, Leontiniidae) during the middle Miocene. This contrasts with the wide latitudinal distribution of clades of other mammals recorded in the fauna, including the sparassodont Lycopsis padillai, the sloth Hyperleptus, and the proterotheriid Lambdaconus cf.

While soft actuators have been one of the most crucial elements of technology leading the development of the soft robotics field, they fall short of force output and bandwidth requirements for many tasks. In addition, other general problems remain open, including robustness, controllability, and repeatability. The SPA-pack architecture presented here aims to satisfy these standards of reliability crucial to the field of soft robotics, while also improving the basic performance capabilities of SPAs by borrowing advantages leveraged ubiquitously in biology; namely, the structured parallel arrangement of lower power actuators to form the basis of a larger and more powerful actuator module. An SPA-pack module consisting of a number of smaller SPAs will be studied using an analytical model and physical prototype. Experimental measurements show an SPA pack to generate over 112 N linear force, while the model indicates the benefit of parallel actuator grouping over a geometrically equivalent single SPA scale as an increasing function of the number of individual actuators in the group. For a module of four actuators, a 23% increase in force production over a volumetrically equivalent single SPA is predicted and validated, while further gains appear possible up to 50%. These findings affirm the advantage of utilizing a fascicle structure for high-performance soft robotic applications over existing monolithic SPA designs. An example of high-performance soft robotic platform will be presented to demonstrate the capability of SPA-pack modules in a complete and functional system.",10.1089/soro.2016.0029,2017-03-01,https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Tk0hNWz2iYvPVpBuvsUUoKIqq5Fu78U,Robertson_SoRo

Such interviews can be long and tedious. In an attempt to improve the respondents’ experience during interviews, we developed a concept of gamified interview by including a game element. Gamification is reported to increase engagement in tasks, but results from rigorously developed research are equivocal, and a theory of gamification is still needed. Materials & methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate the proposed gamification based on the self-determination theory, specifically on the basic psychological needs theory. In total, 1266 respondents were interviewed. Single and multiple mediation analyses were used to understand how gamification works. Results Our evaluation showed that the gamification we had developed did not improve the outcome, i.e. the reported experience of the interview. The effect of gamification depended on the ability of respondents: gamification can be counterproductive if it overburdens the respondents. Finally, the basic psychological needs theory explained the mechanisms of action of gamification well: feeling competent and related to others improved the reported experience of the interview. Conclusion We emphasize the need to develop context-specific gamification and invite researchers to follow equivalently rigorous evaluation of gamification in future studies.",10.25678/0002K9,2021-02-01,https://opendata.eawag.ch/dataset/gamifying-quantitative-face-to-face-interviews,Eawag Eric

We can achieve variable stiffness or impedance in a robotic system purely by the control or by introducing new material or mechanisms to address cases that require innate safety through system compliancy. This paper presents JammJoint, a compliant and flexible wearable robot, which uses jamming of granular media to vary its stiffness. It consists of a silicone sleeve with hollow sections that are filled with cubic rubber granules and subjected to different levels of vacuum pressure. Unlike contemporary vacuum-based actuators or systems, JammJoint is wearable, portable, and autonomous: It uses a powerful miniature vacuum pump, a small battery, and bluetooth-enabled electronics. Experiments revolving around bending and torsional stiffness show that the system is able to achieve up to a fourfold increase in spring stiffness. Further measurements of individual variable stiffness structures indicate that for other modes of deformation, including simply supported bending or compression for alternative linear applications, higher changes in stiffness over a factor of seven are possible. These aspects make mobile jamming-based stiffness variation as wearable joint assistance promising for future applications such as rehabilitation after injuries and joint support in challenging working conditions.",10.1109/LRA.2017.2655109,2017-04-01,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vUxRQWc0J7tVzYn1iTiBu316JsKkfhs0,Hauser_RAL

In addition to actuation, other utilities enabled by vacuum pressure include gripping and stiffening through granular media jamming, as well as direct suction adhesion to smooth surfaces, for manipulation or vertical fixation. We investigate the performance of the new actuator through direct characterization of a 3-DoF, plug-and-play V-SPA Module built from multiple V-SPAs and demonstrate the integration of different vacuum-enabled capabilities with a continuum-style robot platform outfitted with modular peripheral mechanisms. We show that these different vacuum-powered modules can be combined to achieve a variety of tasks-including multimodal locomotion, object manipulation, and stiffness tuning-to illustrate the utility and viability of vacuum as a singular alternative power source for soft pneumatic robots and not just a peripheral feature in itself. Our results highlight the effectiveness of V-SPAs in providing core soft robot capabilities and facilitating the consolidation of previously disparate subsystems for actuation and various specialized tasks, conducive to improving the compact design efficiency of larger, more complex multifunctional soft robotic systems.A foam-based, vacuum-powered actuator enables a multifunctional soft robotic system.A foam-based, vacuum-powered actuator enables a multifunctional soft robotic system.",10.1126/scirobotics.aan6357,2017-08-30,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P20Z8mmYUWRG7ZyAycW6bPGcgGG4Obdz,Robertson_ScienceRobotics

In this manuscript, we propose a novel, modular, wearable robotic device for human (lumbar) spine assistance that is developed using vacuum driven, soft pneumatic actuators (V-SPA). The actuators can handle large, repetitive loads efficiently under compression. Computational models to capture the complex non-linear mechanical behavior of individual actuator modules and the integrated assistive device are developed using the finite element method (FEM). The models presented can predict system behavior at large values of mechanical deformations and allow for rapid design iterations. It is shown that a single actuator module can be used to obtain a variety of different motion and force profiles and yield multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) depending on the module loading conditions, resulting in high system versatility and adaptability, and efficient replication of the targeted motion range for the human spinal cord. The efficacy of the finite element model is first validated for a single module using experimental results that include free displacement and blocked-forces.

The majority of these limited examples have only provided linear force and motion profiles, however, despite the general prevalence of bending actuators common to positive pressure powered SPAs. The benefits of such bending type SPAs follow from the direct production of moment and angular motion that are highly desirable for diverse robotic applications and activities, which allows more simple design of soft robots with complex motion behavior. Following this motivation, a new vacuum powered bending actuator is developed here as an extension of a previously presented vacuum powered actuator, the V-SPA, which features simple, lightweight material construction and rapid fabrication. Leveraging these attributes, an empirical study of a new Coil V-SPA performance is conducted across a spectrum of eight actuator prototypes. The force, speed, and stiffness of the actuators are characterized, and a generalized design metric, the Geometric Compression Ratio (GCR), is defined to quantify the relationship between physical geometric parameters of Coil V-SPAs. Finally, the results of testing reveal the new low-inertia actuator is capable of high-speed, and high-bandwidth motion, up to 0.97 m/s and 1.59 Hz, respectively.",10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2018.8405364,2018-04-01,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QdcHbokL8biW1cpBc4_z7ZdQkreXsYwl,Robertson_RobosoftConf2018

Such variation can be increased by gene flow resulting from immigration, potentially facilitating evolution. But, gene flow could in fact constrain rather than facilitate local adaptive evolution if immigrants have low additive genetic values for local fitness. Local migration-selection balance and micro-evolutionary stasis could then result. However, key quantitative genetic effects of natural immigration, comprising the degrees to which gene flow increases the total local additive genetic variance yet counter-acts local adaptive evolutionary change, have not been explicitly quantified in wild populations. Key implications of gene flow for population and evolutionary dynamics consequently remain unclear. Our quantitative genetic analyses of long-term data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) show that mean breeding value for local juvenile survival to adulthood, a major component of fitness, increased across cohorts more than expected solely due to drift. Such micro-evolutionary change should be expected given non-zero additive genetic variance and consistent directional selection. However, this evolutionary increase was counter-acted by negative additive genetic effects of recent immigrants, which increased total additive genetic variance but prevented a net directional evolutionary increase in total additive genetic value. These analyses imply an approximate quantitative genetic migration-selection balance in a major fitness component, and hence demonstrate a key mechanism by which substantial additive genetic variation can be maintained yet decoupled from local adaptive evolutionary change.",doi:10.5061/dryad.rjdfn2z95,,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.rjdfn2z95,Dryad

The other five phytolith samples (bushgrass Calamagrostis epigejos, common reed Phragmites australis, common horsetail Equisetum arvense, annual and perennial rough horsetail Equisetum hyemale) were separated from plant materials.The individual phytolith fragments were analysed by fsLA-MC-ICP-MS and Si isotope results are reported in the δ-notation (delta) as permil deviation relative to NIST SRM610, which is isotopically indistinguishable from the reference material NBS28 (quartz NIST SRM8546 alias NBS28, δ29Si ≡ 0 and δ30Si ≡ 0). Raw data processing and background corrections were made according to the protocol described in Schuessler and von Blanckenburg (2014) that also involves application of several data rejection/acceptance criteria. Of these, the most important ones are that A) only 30/28Si and 29/28Si ratios are used for the calculation which deviate less than 3 standard deviation from the mean and B) only results which follow the mass-depended terrestrial fractionation line in a three-isotope-plot of δ29Si vs. δ30Si within analytical uncertainties and C) have a mass bias drift between the two bracketing standards of less than 0.30 ‰ in 30/28Si are accepted and reported in this study.Detailed description of the sample origin, preparation steps, and the measurement protocol can be found in Frick, D.

People Analytics refers to the practice of personnel development in which digital data from internal and external sources relating to human capital are systematically evaluated using information technology in order to make decisions that increase the value of a company. The author begins by identifying the differences between people analytics and older forms of monitoring in the workplace as well as the resulting legal problems. After considering the various applicable fields of law, he focuses on the analysis of employment and data protection law. Key findings include the following three facts: that data protection regulations, which are predominantly procedural in nature, must be interpreted in a risk-oriented manner; that, in the work context, consent should be avoided as a reason to justify data processing; and that there are deficiencies in the enforcement of data protection in private law. Based on this, the author develops an improvement concept aimed at professionalising and democratising data protection law. He contrasts his theoretical considerations with the empirical data that he has collected as part of an interdisciplinary research project. In addition to the existing Swiss Data Protection Act, this dissertation takes into account the proposals for the future, fully revised Swiss Data Protection Act, the EU General Data Protection Regulation and selected aspects of US data protection law.The dissertation has won the Stefano Rodotà Award of the Council of Europe and the Professor Walther Hug Prize.",https://doi.org/10.3256/978-3-03929-009-3,2021-08-30,https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/262428/,Alexandria

163292,7A1368DC-5C0E-4E19-B10D-3775C7560A70,Modeling vacuum bellows soft pneumatic actuators with optimal mechanical performance,"This paper presents the concept and model of “Vacuum Bellows,” a cylindrical membrane-reinforced contractile vacuum soft pneumatic actuator (V-SPAs). These actuators consist of a tubular membrane connected to a series of interior rigid rings periodically spaced along its length. Our model shows how the rings can be spaced to achieve a desired actuator force profile. For example, the contraction ratio can be maximized by spacing the rings one diameter apart inside the tube. The work output of the actuator can be concentrated in the initial portion of the stroke by increasing the ring spacing. And, usefully, an approximately constant force-to-pressure relationship can be created by spacing the rings a fraction of a diameter apart. Our experimental results highlight the utility of the model and some practical considerations for actuator fabrication and use. The experimental results demonstrate how the ring spacing can be used to achieve high peak forces per unit pressure (three times greater than an equivalent-diameter piston achieved experimentally) or large contractions (achieved contraction to 30 % of the extended length). Our model suggests that this performance can be improved with improved fabrication techniques.",10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2018.8405381,2018-04-01,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1evbza7vQyJHx90PaJIVi1MfgpS3TAGJU,Felt_RobosoftConf2018

This framework features modules joined together over a simple embedded pneumatic and serial communication network and requires a unique approach to both low-level control implementation and high-level control strategy. We describe the structure and activation characteristics of a V-SPA Module and present practical methods for its control. These methods utilize software generated PWM activation through a unique serial protocol designed for LED networks and a heuristic mapping strategy for simplifying the spherical control of 3-DoF actuator modules.",10.1109/IROS.2017.8202296,2017-09-01,https://drive.google.com/open?id=17MikY6iCtVCmrheh8tdfNyFdsVF41osM,Robertson_IROS2017
163292,83B2EED8-6ACE-4FBE-9F5C-FE17D0D98914,A Compact Modular Soft Surface With Reconfigurable Shape and Stiffness,"A variety of reconfigurable surface devices, utilizing large numbers of actuated physical pixels to produce discretized three-dimensional contours, have been developed for different purposes in research and industry. The difficulty of integrating many actuators in close configuration has limited the DOF and resolution and performance of existing devices. Utilizing vacuum power and soft material actuators, we have developed a soft reconfigurable surface (SRS) with multimodal control and performance capabilities. The SRS is comprised of a square grid array of linear vacuum-powered soft pneumatic actuators, built into plug-and-play modules which enable the arrangement, consolidation, and control of many DoF. In addition to the practical benefits of system integration, this architecture facilitates the construction of customized assemblies with an overall compact form factor. A series of experiments is performed to illustrate and validate the versatility of the SRS for achieving diverse tasks including force-controlled modulation of interface pressure through integrated sensors, lateral manipulation of a variety of objects, static and dynamic shape and pattern generation for haptic interaction, and variable surface stiffness tuning. This SRS concept is scalable, space efficient, and features diverse functional potential. This will extend the utility and accessibility of tangible robotic interfaces for future applications from industrial to home and personal use.",10.1109/TMECH.2018.2878621,2018-10-29,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hWQL-yKM0LSWls-DvB4e1FkyCMnSsHpV,Robertson_TMECH

We construct the first complete database of investor losses (“haircuts”) in all restructurings with foreign banks and bondholders from 1970 until 2010, covering 180 cases in 68 countries. We then show that restructurings involving higher haircuts are associated with significantly higher subsequent bond yield spreads and longer periods of capital market exclusion.

The flocks originated from two major British Egg producer organisations.To investigate the behavioural mechanisms of piling behaviour on British layer flocks, I first assessed the flock behaviour of 27 layer flocks and recording 70 individual video recording locations. The following data set contains the results of the video assessments. In total, I spotted and characterised 92 piling events. The characterisation of piles includes piling specifics such as the start time, end time, duration, trigger, and the number of involved animals. Furthermore, I provide relevant information (including breed, population age, production system) about the flocks where I spotted piling behaviour (20 flocks). Finally, I provide relevant information about environmental factors associated with piling behaviour, including the lighting schedule, flock size, colony size and production form. This data set is unique as it is the first describing piling behaviour across multiple British layer flocks. Furthermore, it provides a good ground for testing relations between flock characteristics and environmental factors of the birds and piling behaviour. I will publish this data set after publishing my findings in an international journal.",*updated after publication,,www.re3data.org,www.re3data.org

Jahrhundert in Musikästhetik und Musikkritik die essentielle Frage, wie das Konzept von «Form in Musik» überhaupt angemessen zu verstehen sei, kontrovers diskutiert. Die Untersuchung «Konzeptualisierung von Form in Musik» demonstriert, dass sich seit ca. 1800 entscheidende Einflüsse auf die Auffassung von «Form in Musik» aus der breiteren Ideengeschichte sowie aus philosophischer Ästhetik und experimenteller Psychologie herleiten. Anhand wichtiger Tendenzen wie der Entwicklung des ästhetischen Formalismus, der ‹allgemeinen Kunstwissenschaften› (Max Dessoir), der Wirkung phänomenologischen Denkens und der Gestalttheorie auf die Musiktheorie werden essentielle Stationen, Entwicklungen und Wendepunkte der Diskurse über «Form in Musik» analysiert. Aus dieser transdisziplinären Perspektive heraus wird deutlich, dass ein subjektbezogener Formbegriff immer stärker in den Vordergrund rückt.

Upon ethical approval by The Royal Veterinary College, interviews with farmers were audio recorded. The audio recordings were transcribed using the Online transcribe function of Microsoft Word. I scanned the audio transcripts for relevant statements of farmers associated with piling behaviour and smothering. Based on these efforts, I could sort the statements into relevant themes. This data set contains the original interview statements of farmers and themes induced by the assessor. This data set provides a unique, highly detailed, and strong ground for further hypotheses for investigating piling behaviour and smothering.

However, because HL-60 cells proliferate in an incompletely differentiated state, they must undergo differentiation before they acquire the functional properties of neutrophils. Here we provide evidence of swarming and chemotaxis in differentiated HL-60 neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) using precise microfluidic assays. We found that dimethyl sulfoxide differentiated HL-60 cells (DdHL-60) have a larger size, increased length, and lower ability to squeeze through narrow channels compared to primary neutrophils. They migrate through tapered microfluidic channels slower than primary neutrophils, but faster than HL-60s differentiated by other protocols, e.g., using all-trans retinoic acid. We found that dHL-60 can swarm toward zymosan particle clusters, though they display disorganized migratory patterns and produce swarms of smaller size compared to primary neutrophils.",10.6084/m9.figshare.14445363,2021-12-12,https://figshare.com/s/732fd7c0061c3608ce43,Figshare

An exceptionally well preserved skeleton Thomashuxleya externa (Mammalia, Notoungulata), from the Eocene of Patagonia, Argentina. Palaeontologia electr","We describe one of the oldest notoungulate skeletons with associated craniodental and postcranial elements: Thomashuxleya externa (Isotemnidae) from Cañadón Vaca in Patagonia, Argentina (Vacan subage of the Casamayoran SALMA, middle Eocene). We provide body mass estimates given by different elements of the skeleton, describe the bone histology, and study its phylogenetic position. We note differences in the scapulae, humerii, ulnae and radii of the new specimen in comparison with other specimens previously referred to this taxon. We estimate a body mass of 84 ± 24.2 kg, showing that notoungulates had acquired a large body mass by the middle Eocene. Bone histology shows that the new specimen was skeletally mature. The new material supports the placement of Thomashuxleya as an early, divergent member of Toxodontia. Among placentals, our phylogenetic analysis of a combined DNA, collagen, and morphology matrix favor only a limited number of possible phylogenetic relationships, but cannot yet arbitrate between potential affinities with Afrotheria or Laurasiatheria. With no constraint, maximum parsimony supports Thomashuxleya and Carodnia with Afrotheria. With Notoungulata and Litopterna constrained as monophyletic (including Macrauchenia and Toxodon known for collagens), these clades are reconstructed on the stem to Euungulata (i.e., Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla). Unconstrained, Bayesian analysis weakly supports the possibility that Thomashuxleya is a stem xenarthran; with Notoungulata and Litopterna constrained as monophyletic, the two clades are recovered as sister to Perissodactyla. Anatomical data sampled thus far for Thomashuxleya, combined with collagen amino acids for Pleistocene meridiungulates, substantially limit the number of possible affinities for endemic South American species among mammals, although ambiguity still remains.",10.7934/P2084,2017-07-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.7934/P2084,MorphoBank

We recently discovered that additional modulation of signaling pathways with small molecules facilitates reprogramming to more primitive induced muscle progenitor cells (iMPCs). However, the mechanisms by which a single transcription factor drives differentiated cells into distinct developmental states remain unknown. We therefore dissected the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of fibroblasts undergoing MyoD-dependent reprogramming to either myotubes or iMPCs using a novel MyoD transgenic model. To this end, we performed single cell RNA sequencing for Pax7-nGFP positive iMPCs/satellite cells and cells undergoing dedifferentiation (i.e. Dox+FRG) or transdifferentiation (i.e. Dox) Our analyses elucidate the role of MyoD in myogenic reprogramming and derive general principles by which transcription factors and signaling pathways cooperate to rewire cell identity. Our results may also inform on potential therapeutic applications of direct reprogramming.",GSE171039,2022-03-29,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE171039,GEO

A manifestation of the extreme perception that emerged amidst the uncertainty and challenge to seeing brought on by urban warfare, the street paintings erected by Protestant motorbike-taxi drivers signaled a radical departure from the aniconic tradition of the old colonial church, a desire to be seen and recognized by political authorities from Jakarta to the UN and European Union, an aim to reinstate the Christian look of a city in the face of widespread islamicization, and an opening to a more intimate relationship to the divine through the bringing-into-vision of the Christian god. Stridently assertive, these affectively charged mediations of religion, masculinity, Christian privilege and subjectivity are only one among the myriad ephemera of war and its aftermath analyzed in the book from graffiti, incendiary pamphlets and Video CDs to Peace Provocateur text-messages and children’s reconciliation drawings. In Orphaned Landscapes, Patricia Spyer theorizes the production of the monumental street art and other visual media as part of a wider work on appearance in which ordinary people refigure and transform the aesthetic forms and sensory environment of their urban surrounds. The book offers a nuanced account of a place in crisis and motion and an analysis of how the work on appearance, far from epiphenomenal, is inherent to significant sociopolitical change in Indonesia as elsewhere.",10.5422/OA/1874,2021-11-02,https://repository.graduateinstitute.ch/,Graduate Institute Institutional Repository

The role these particles play in the global radiative balance and in the climate system is still uncertain. To better quantify their radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation interactions, we need to improve process level understanding of aging processes, which lead to either ‘browning’ or ‘bleaching’ of organic aerosols. Currently available laboratory techniques aim to simulate atmospheric aerosol aging and measure the evolving light absorption, but suffer from low sensitivity and precision. This study describes the use of electrodynamic balance photophoretic spectroscopy (EDB-PPS) for high sensitivity and high precision measurements of light absorption by a single particle. We demonstrate the retrieval of time-evolving imaginary part of the refractive index for a single levitated particle in the range of 10-4 to 10-5 with uncertainties of less than 25% and 60%, respectively. The experimental system is housed within an environmental chamber, in which aging processes can be simulated in realistic atmospheric conditions and lifetime of days to weeks. This high level of sensitivity enables future studies to explore the major processes responsible for formation and degradation of brown carbon aerosols.",10.3929/ethz-b-000419840,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/419840,ETH Zuerich Research Collection

The recent accumulation of genomic data provides promising opportunities to understand the genomic landscape of divergence, which describes the distribution of differences across genomes. Genomic areas of unusually high differentiation have been called genomic islands of divergence. Their formation has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms, but a prominent hypothesis is that they result from divergent selection over a small portion of the genome, with surrounding areas homogenised by gene flow. Such islands have often been interpreted as being associated with divergence with gene flow. However other mechanisms related to genomic structure and population history can also contribute to the formation of genomic islands of divergence.We currently lack a quantitative framework to examine the dynamics of genomic landscapes under the complex and nuanced conditions that are found in natural systems. Here, we develop an individual-based simulation to explore the dynamics of diverging genomes under various scenarios of gene flow, selection and genotype-phenotype maps.Our modelling results are consistent with empirical observations demonstrating the formation of genomic islands under genetic isolation. Importantly, we have quantified the range of conditions that produce genomic islands. We demonstrate that the initial level of genetic diversity, drift, time since divergence, linkage disequilibrium, strength of selection and gene flow are all important factors that can influence the formation of genomic islands. Because the accumulation of genomic differentiation over time tends to erode the signal of genomic islands, genomic islands are more likely to be observed in recently divergent taxa, although not all recently diverged taxa will necessarily exhibit islands of genomic divergence. Gene flow primarily slows the swamping of islands of divergence with time.By using this framework, further studies may explore the relative influence of particular suites of events that contribute to the emergence of genomic islands under sympatric, parapatric and allopatric conditions. This approach represents a novel tool to explore quantitative expectations of the speciation process, and should prove useful in elucidating past and projecting future genomic evolution of any taxa.",10.5061/dryad.12jm63xt0,2020-11-05,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.12jm63xt0,Dryad

The deck unit recorded the temperature and the time since the probe was launched. This time was then converted to depth using the known fall rate of the probe in seawater and the coefficients provided by the manufacturer (WMO standards; Hanawa et al., 1995). The profiles were corrected for known surface biases (Kizu and Hanawa, 2002; Uehara et al., 2008). We provide the raw data, the data produced by using the coefficients provided by the manufacturer, and a corrected version in which we apply an empirical correction based on a comparison with CTD data (Henry et al., 2019), where XBT profiles were launched alongside the CTD deployment. The data has been quality controlled by comparing it to a number of CTD profiles. Data is provided at full vertical resolution and a 1-m averaged resolution. In addition, we provide derived variables such as surface mixed layer depth (temperature threshold) estimates. We are grateful to the crew of the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov and AARI for donating these probes to our project. Their use-by date had expired, however this was not seen as an issue. This data set provides insights into the hydrography of the Southern Ocean during one austral summer season and complements the CTD temperature profiles measured during ACE by filling in the gaps between CTD stations.",10.5281/zenodo.3836648,2020-10-20,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3836648,Zenodo
186681,EC843724-7C76-4F6F-9B26-C485C0FD3C14,Sea-ice induced Southern Ocean subsurface warming and surface cooling in a warming climate: ROMS model data,"This data set contains model output data from the regional ocean modelling system (ROMS) that was set up for the Southern Ocean (south of 24 °S; Haumann, 2016) to analyze the effects of changing surface freshwater and momentum fluxes on Southern Ocean water-mass changes over the period 1980 to 2011. All data is provided in NetCDF format. The data set contains 3 sets 40-year long model spin-up, control, and 3 perturbation simulations each. The sets differ by their model mean state to assess the effect of surface salinity biases on the results. One set of simulations are reference simulations where salinity is restored to the observed surface salinity during model spin-up, and the other two sets are simulations in which the restoring surface salinity has been altered by plus and minus 0.1 PSU, respectively. The control and perturbation simulations are 40-year extensions of the respective model spin-up simulations. In the perturbation simulations either the surface freshwater fluxes or momentum fluxes are instantaneously perturbed after the spin-up simulation to reflect the observation-derived changes in these surface fluxes and then held constant (at the perturbed level) for 40 years. They consist of sea-ice freshwater flux, glacial meltwater flux, and atmosphere-ocean momentum flux changes. Details on the model setup, forcing, and simulations can be obtained from the related research article by Haumann et al.

This is mostly a result of fruitful cooperation between corresponding business experts and experts in relevant areas of the computing science. Natural sciences however, especially those frontiers like particle physics and cosmology at their extremes usually use different model: modern CS ideas are accommodated by specialists educated in the natural science, not by CS experts. In the presentation I will discuss pro and contra of this approach, give an overview which kind of problems may be better addressed using Machine Learning techniques. What may be expected when people apply ML to natural sciences, and which questions are still opened.

Palazzi rinascimentali di Lombardia in età sforzesca,"The book examines the private palaces in the Duchy of Milan during the Sforza era, designed and built between Ludovico il Moro's seizure of power in 1480 and the first quarter of the following century. The result is a catalogue of examples that are essential for understanding the development of the typology and the emergence of a new housing model capable of including, among its functions, that of representing, by fixing it in a building, the social, political and cultural role of the client.Extensive chapters are devoted to the individual palazzi, which we can recognise - in the famous expression of Pietro Aretino - as ""modernly ancient and antiquely modern"". These chapters analyse them from various perspectives and lead to the identification of an innovative line in Lombard art, not only through examples in Milan, but also with precise verifications in Pavia, Piacenza, Lodi, Cremona, Crema and Vigevano, in parallel with what was happening in Florence or Venice, in Mantua or Ferrara and finally, at a slightly later date, in Rome.Through the analysis of the general advancement of architectural culture as a whole and of the interconnections between building sites, craftsmen and linguistic inventions, the range of architectures considered widens considerably to include some crucial religious buildings and, subsequently, several Roman palaces, where the descent of the ""Lombards"" - from Bramante from Urbino, by then integrated in Milanese cultural circles, to Bramantino and Cristoforo Solari - paved the way for decisive and critically inescapable exchanges.",9788822911636,2021-02-27,https://www.quodlibet.it/libro/9788822911636,Quodlibet publishing house

Many examples of collaboration with the data-science community within competitions organised on Kaggle or Coda Lab platforms usually get limited by restrictions on those platforms. Common metrics do not necessarily correspond to the goal of the original research. Constraints imposed by the problem statement typically look artificial for ML-community. Preparing a perfect competition takes a considerable amount of efforts. On the contrary research process requires a lot of flexibility and ability to look at the problem from different angles. I’ll describe the alternative research collaboration process can bridge the gap between domain-specific research and data science community. Particularly, it can involve academic researchers, younger practitioners and all enthusiasts who are willing to contribute.

One of the types of material studied was deep eutectic solvent assisted poly(polyol-co-citrate) polymers (DES citrate polymers). These are transparent, enabling possible application in optics, flexible, and have been shown to be biocompatible.DES-poly(polyol-co-citrate) polymers require several days cross linking time (curing time), typically 10 days at 80oC to become gel like materials. The aim here is to understand their mechnical properties as a function of curing time to obtain materials optimally matched to the mechanical properties of biological tissue with a view towards implants. The AFM files published here contain data on Young's modulus, adhesion, and dissipation for samples cured for different numbers of days, as well as the corresponding topography images.Associated FTIR spectra for the DES poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate) samples are included.The AFM data were recorded using Peak Force QNM on a Bruker FastScan AFM in the EPFL Center of MicroNanoTechnology",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4944883,2021-06-14,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4944883,Zenodo

205779,099DBC51-7328-411A-8925-F09FC69CF13C,Associations de migrants et coopération internationale. Agriculture et développement durable au Sénégal,"Since the global food crisis of 2008, Senegalese migrant associations have become involved in the agricultural development of their localities of origin, and through their projects they have created a transnational dynamic characterised by the circulation of goods, innovations and skills between the host and the origin areas. In this book, attention is focused on the analysis of a series of associative projects initiated by Senegalese migrants in three European countries, France, Switzerland and Italy. These countries differ in terms of policies aimed at supporting and recognising migrant and diaspora associations in their role as actors of cooperation. The comparison is significant in order to understand whether the factors specific to each host context have an impact on the associative dynamics and on the characteristics of the projects in terms of sustainable agricultural development. Such an analysis is also useful for other host and home countries. It consents to put forward considerations that aim to enrich the current debate on the links between migration and development, which is taking place from the global to the local level among researchers, international organisations, state actors, NGOs, as well as migrant and diaspora associations.",10.33058/seismo.20746,2021-12-10,https://www.seismoverlag.ch/fr/daten/associations-de-migrants-et-cooperation-internationale/,seismo verlag

The omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have a high potential to affect consumer fitness, through their widespread effects on reproduction, growth, and survival. However, few studies consider the evolution of fatty acid metabolism within an ecological context. In the paper associated with this dataset, we document the extensive diversity in both primary producer and consumer fatty acid distributions among major ecosystems, between habitats, and among species within habitats. This dataset on fatty acid composition on primary producers and consumers from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems is used to create Figure 2 in the paper. The data consists of alpha linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), EPA, and DHA as percent of total fatty acids.",10.5061/dryad.dfn2z351d,2021-04-22,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.dfn2z351d,Dryad

186657,D7126901-CF08-4BC8-86C6-0F555B33CACB,HathorBank,"HathorBank is the first result of a 2 years PostDoctoral project reassessing the presence of words of Levantine orginis in Late Egyptian (Late Bronze Age). Several words of Levantine origins (especially Semitic, but not only) are known in Egyptian, and various publications listing them exist. However, these words have never been studied from a perspective that systematically investigates their linguistic history, and that explores the socio-cultural context(s) of their transfer and use(s).Moreover, this very rich linguistic material (which e.g. includes the earliest attestations of several Semitic words) has often been presented in forms that targeted a primarily Egyptological audience, rather than being aimed at the wider linguistic community.The HathorBank project takes these considerations into account, and builds on previous and current scholarship in order to further explore both the linguistic dimension of these words and what their presence in Egyptian can tell us about the interactions of the societies of the time.This database constitutes the first output of this project, and its main aim is to make the primary data available. It will soon be followed by a publication that will tackle methodological issues, and which will provide a socio-historical analysis of these words and their spread. As a start, my project has focused on a selection of 243 words that have been identified in previous scholarship as very likely Levantine loanwords (mostly categories 4 and 5 in the classification by Hoch 1994 Semitic Words in Egyptian Texts). Other words will hopefully be added in the future (and collaborations in this direction are very welcome).The present database makes the primary data available and provides, for each word, a reconstruction of their vocalization (wherever possible), a general overview of the distribution of their attestations (across time, and across texts), and a punctual discussion of their relevant features.",https://hathorbank.herokuapp.com/HathorBank/,,https://hathorbank.herokuapp.com/HathorBank/,HathorBank

It is unclear, however, if this shared information reflects a modality-specific component of pain, or alternatively a supramodal code for properties common to many aversive experiences (unpleasantness, salience, etc.). To address this issue, we conducted experiments involving social inclusion or exclusion. Following each gaming experience, a painful or disgusting stimulation of comparable unpleasantness were delivered. This design allows to assess whether the effect of social exclusion on subjective pain (as found in the literature) does generalize to other unpleasant painless experiences.",10.17605/OSF.IO/ZTY6R,2018-12-05,https://osf.io/zty6r/,Open Science Framework

The task is based on data collected from a speech-enabled online tool which has been used to help young Swiss German teens practise skills in English conversation. Items are prompt-response pairs, where the prompt is a piece of German text and the response is a recorded English audio file. The task is to label pairs as “accept” or “reject”, accepting responses which are grammatically and linguistically correct to match a set of hidden gold standard answers as closely as possible. Resources are provided so that a scratch system can be constructed with a minimal investment of effort, and in particular without necessarily using a speech recogniser.The first edition of the task was announced at LREC 2016, with training data released in July 2016 and test data in March 2017, and attracted 20 entries from 9 groups. Results, including seven papers, were presented at the SLaTE workshop in August 2017. Full details, including links to resources, results and papers, can be found on the Shared Task home page.Following the success of the original task, we are organising a second edition. We will approximately double the amount of training data, provide new test data, and release improved versions of the accompanying resources. In particular, we will make generally available the open source Kaldi recogniser developed by the University of Birmingham, which achieved the best performance on the original task, together with versions of the training and test data pre-processed through this recogniser.

Ever since the first manned flight by the Brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright on December 17th 1903, utilitarian sheds next to landing strips on cow pastures evolved into a completely new building type over the next few decades - into places of Modernism as envisioned by Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright (who themselves never built an airport), to eventually turn into icons of cultural identity, progress and prosperity. In Europe, military aerodromes created during the First World War, such as Bourget and Croydon airports in France and Great Britain respectively, were transformed into civilian airport terminals.Many of these airports have become architectural branding devices of their respective cities, regions and countries, created by some of the most notable contemporary architects.. This interdisciplinary cultural study deals with the historical formation and transformation of the architectural typology of airports under the aspect of spatial theories. This includes the shift from early spaces of transportation such as train stations, the synesthetic effect of travel and mobility and the effects of material innovations on the development, occupation and use of such spaces. The changing uses from mere utilitarian transportation spaces to ones centered on the spectacular culture of late capitalism, consumption and identity formation in a rapidly changing global culture are analyzed with examples both from architectural and philosophical points of view. The origins of this glass and iron architecture can be traced to Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace, built for the Great Exhibition of 1851. This was the first time that the exhibition venue itself took a backseat to its architecture. The composition of the interior and the perception thereof were of a fluid nature with myriads of possibilities for interior design. The crystalline exhibition and dwelling premises of the Crystal Palace were the idealized interiors where the enlightened citizens dwelled and strolled as analyzed in Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project, they were consequently recreated in arcades, tea rooms, cafés and grand train stations at the turn of the century, setting the stage for what would become urban realm and airport architecture. Much like ubiquitous modern day coffee shops, airports aim to be the third place as per Ray Oldenburg, but are rather a non-place according to Marc Augé and a Foucauldian interplay between heterotopias, utopias and dystopias. Many have become nightmarish panopticons of migration, surveillance and control, triggered by the events surrounding the terrorist attacks of the last two decades. Current airport design puts an emphasis on the regional and anthropological place to counteract the dehumanization of mass transportation. Its transitory character is fused with art exhibition sites, culminating in airport-museum-hybrids, such as Mumbai and Doha airports. The future of airport architecture and design very much looks like the original idea of the Crystal Palace: to provide a stage for consumption, social theatre and art exhibition.",DOI,2019-12-31,www.vdf.ch,vdf.ch

179089,AF3A37AB-9E90-4A2D-A2CC-CCAA5902130B,Inferring species interactions in ecological communities: a comparison of methods at different levels of complexity,"1. Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions. 2. We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinction-based model, a relative yield model and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispecies community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. 3. The relative yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities. 4. We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multispecies community dynamics across multiple functional groups. 5. Our work unites available tools to measure species interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management-oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems.",10.5061/dryad.20cp7,2016-02-26,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.20cp7,Dryad

Thus, an understanding of what microorganisms are released and howthey changemicrobial communities within natural streams is needed. To characterize the community shifts in streams receiving WWTP effluent, we sampled water-column microorganisms from upstream, downstream, and the effluent of WWTPs located on 23 headwater streams in which no other effluent was released upstream. We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.Wehypothesized that the downstreamcommunity profilewould be a hydraulicmixture between the twosources (i.e., upstreamand effluent). In ordination analyses, the downstream bacterial community profile was a mixture between the upstream and effluent. For 14 of the sites, the main contribution (N50%) to the downstreamcommunity originated from bacteria in the WWTP effluent and significant shifts in relative abundance of specific sequence variants were detected. These shifts in sequence variants may serve as general bioindicators of wastewater-effluent influenced streams,with a human-gut related Ruminococcus genus displaying the highest shift (30-fold higher abundances downstream). However, not all taxa composition changeswere predicted based on hydraulicmixing alone. Specifically, the decrease of Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast readswas not adequately described by hydraulicmixing. The potential alteration of stream microbial communities via a high inflow of human-gut related bacteria and a decrease in autotrophicfunctional groups resulting fromWWTP effluent creates the potential for general shifts in stream ecosystem function.",0000-0002-4831-6958,2020-03-01,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4540304.v1.,Dryad
179089,6D1E1DCC-A359-49DC-8F1D-D56E84267827,Gene swamping alters evolution during range expansions in the protist Tetrahymena thermophila,"At species’ range edges, individuals often face novel environmental conditions that may limit range expansion until populations adapt. The potential to adapt depends on genetic variation upon which selection can act. However, populations at species’ range edges are often genetically depauperate. One mechanism increasing genetic variation is reshuffling existing variation through sex. Sex, however, can potentially limit adaptation by breaking up existing beneficial allele combinations (recombination load). The gene swamping hypothesis predicts this is specifically the case when populations expand along an abiotic gradient and asymmetric dispersal leads to numerous maladapted dispersers from the range core swamping the range edge. We used the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila as a model for testing the gene swamping hypothesis. We performed replicated range expansions in landscapes with or without a pH-gradient, while simultaneously manipulating the occurrence of gene flow and sexual versus asexual reproduction. We show that sex accelerated evolution of local adaptation in the absence of gene flow, but hindered it in the presence of gene flow. However, sex affected adaptation independently of the pH-gradient, indicating that both abiotic gradients and the biotic gradient in population density lead to gene swamping. Overall, our results show that gene swamping alters adaptation in life-history strategies.",0000-0002-4831-6958,2020-06-17,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgmtk,Dryad

Ecological drift, dispersal, and biotic interactions also structure communities, and although these mechanisms are more difficult to detect, they may be of equal importance in natural communities. Here, we hypothesized that in ten naturally-replicated headwater streams in Eastern Switzerland, locally-dominant amphipod species would be associated with differences in environmental conditions. We conducted repeated surveys of amphipods and used a hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less frequently than predicted by the model, which was surprising because laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their distribution and that a blocking effect related to the specific linear configuration of streams determines which species colonizes and dominates a given stream catchment, thus suggesting a new solution a long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.",10.5061/dryad.75jq1,2018-03-26,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.75jq1,Dryad

A central question in the Covid-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors have influenced its progression. To address this question, we used mortality rates during the first three weeks of recorded mortality in 144 countries, during the first wave of the pandemic. We examined the effect of climatic variables, along with the proportion of the population older than 64 years old, the number of beds in hospitals, and the timing and strength of the governmental travel measures to control the spread of the disease. Our first model focuses on air temperature as the central climatic factor and explains 67% of the variation in mortality rate, with 37% explained by the fixed variables considered and 31% explained by country-specific variations. We show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~5%. Our second model is centred on the UV Index and follows the same trend as air temperature, explaining 69% of the variation in mortality rate. These results are robust to the exclusion of countries with low incomes, as well as to the exclusion of low- and medium-income countries. We also show that the proportion of vulnerable age classes and access to healthcare are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of this disease. The effects of air temperature at an early stage of the Covid-19 outbreak is a key factor to understand the primary spread of this pandemic, and should be considered in projecting subsequent waves.",10.5061/dryad.1ns1rn8th.,2021-06-15,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1ns1rn8th,Dryad

The task is based on data collected from a speech-enabled online tool which has been used to help young Swiss German teens practise skills in English conversation. Items are prompt-response pairs, where the prompt is a piece of German text and the response is a recorded English audio file. The task is to label pairs as “accept” or “reject”, accepting responses which are grammatically and linguistically correct to match a set of hidden gold standard answers as closely as possible. Resources are provided so that a scratch system can be constructed with a minimal investment of effort, and in particular without necessarily using a speech recogniser.The first edition of the Shared Task was carried out in 2017, with results presented at the SLaTE 2017 workshop in Stockholm. The second edition, with improved training data and improved baseline recogniser resources, was carried out in 2018, results this time being presented at a special session of Interspeech 2018 in Hyderabad. Details, including full results and links to all the papers, are available from the Shared Task 1 site and the Shared Task 2 site.The third edition of the Shared Task will make available the same training data and resources as the second edition. There will be new test data. Given the strong results reported in the second edition, we are also making an important change: THE THIRD EDITION WILL USE A NEW METRIC. This new metric, Dfull, is defined in the instructions tab and motivated in §5 of the Interspeech 2018 overview paper. Unlike the metric used in the two previous editions of the Shared Task, which focused on optimizing performance for correct student responses (i.e. responses which should be accepted), Dfull places equal weight on correct and incorrect utterances. Since incorrect responses are considerably harder to process than correct ones, we expect Dfull to pose interesting new challenges.","Spoken CALL Shared Task, third edition",,https://regulus.unige.ch/spokencallsharedtask_3rdedition/,"Spoken CALL Shared Task, third edition"

On a global scale, the species richness of several subterranean invertebrate taxa parallels species richness found in surface waters, while on a local scale species richness hardly exceeds 20 species. This results in a high contribution of groundwater ecosystems to regional β- and γ-diversity, and to a smaller degree to α-diversity, and deserves focused attention. In general, more species are to be found in large cave systems. The second largest cave system in Europe is Hölloch in Switzerland. In this paper we revised the taxonomic, phylogenetic and ecological diversity of the amphipod community in the Hölloch cave system. While previous records listed five geographically widespread species of the genus Niphargus for this cave system, we could not confirm the presence of any of those species, but rather found three highly distinct species new to science. In this paper we describe Niphargus styx sp. nov., Niphargus murimali sp. nov., and Niphargus muotae sp. nov., and suggest that previous records from that cave were probably misidentifications. Although amphipod species richness in this cave system seems to be lower than previously thought in terms of absolute numbers, the cave retained its regional and international importance in terms of nature conservation for multiple reasons. First, all newly described species are probably endemic to this cave system. Second, they are phylogenetically distantly related and exhibit moderate to high phylogenetic diversity. Third, the species, as inferred from their functional morphology, are also ecologically highly divergent. Based on geographic distribution of their nearest relatives, we hypothesize that the cave system was most likely independently colonized from North, West and South and that the pre-adapted ancestors occupied different ecological niches within the system.",10.5061/dryad.pp176,2017-09-30,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pp176,Dryad

188014,5258ACCA-CEA2-4338-A847-AB5EFD98FC69,Sheaves of Twisted Cherednik Algebras as Universal Filtered Formal Deformations,"According to a statement by Pavel Etingof, in the special case of an affine variety X with a faithful action by a finite group G, the sheaf of (twisted) Cherednik algebras H_{c, \psi} with formal parameters c, \psi is a universal formal deformation of D_X#G where D_X is the sheaf of differential operators on X. In the current note, we generalize Etingof's result to the non-affine case. We prove that for a generic smooth analytic or algebraic variety X, the sheaf H_{c, \psi} with formal c and \psi is a universal filtered formal deformation of D_X#G. To that aim, we first construct quasi-isomorphisms between the Hochschild (co)chain complex of D_X#G and the G-invariant part of the direct sum over all elements g in G of sheaves of holomorphic differential forms on the cotangent bundles of the g-fixed point submanifolds in X. Finally, we combine these quasi-isomorphisms with results from the theory of algebraic extensions for sheaves of filtered associative algebras to establish a bijective correspondence between the space of isomorphism classes of filtered infinitesimal deformations of D_X#G and the parameter space of H_{c, \psi}.",arXiv:2007.01399v2,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01399,ARXIV

While performing Percoll density gradient separation of RBCs from healthy individuals and their subsequent characterization, we identified a fraction of cells in the low-density fraction (~0.025% compared to total RBCs population) which shows reversal in their densities along with the characteristics of cellular senescence such as loss of membrane Band 3 protein and the phosphatidylserine exposure to the outer membrane leaflet. Our subsequent analysis showed that these cells are overloaded with Ca2+. We further measured intracellular [Na+] in individual RBCs by flow cytometry utilizing the dye CoroNa Green-AM.  Our findings showed that the cells with senescent characteristics lost their transmembrane Na+ gradient despite maintaining the membrane integrity. Consequently, these findings lead us to designate these cells as “senescent-like” cells. Our data further demonstrated altered activities of nonselective cation channels and pumps in these cells. In addition to a facilitated Na+ extrusion by Na+, K+-ATPase, our findings indicated altered ion transport via Piezo1 in these cells. Pharmacological modulation of Piezo1 with Yoda1/GsMTx4 showed that Piezo1 and, possibly, other nonselective cation channels by promiscuously transporting Na+ and Ca2+ play an important role in producing these low density “senescent like” cells.",10.5281/zenodo.5839743,2022-01-12,https://zenodo.org/record/5839743#.Yd6Kg_7MLZ8,Zenodo

Treading water, or maintaining a stable head position above the water surface, can be achieved in several different ways. Determining which treading water techniques are economic (energetically and cognitively) is an important step in providing evidence-based water safety instruction. Skilled water treaders (n = 21) performed four common treading techniques for 3 minutes each: ‘running’ in the water, ‘flutter kick’ with hands sculling, ‘upright breaststroke’, and ‘egg-beater’. Self-reported rate of perceived exertion and task load, as well as objective measures of probe reaction time, oxygen consumption and heart rate were assessed. The ‘egg-beater’ technique and the ‘upright breaststroke’ technique were linked to significantly lower cognitive and energetic demands compared to the other techniques. Our multidisciplinary analysis shows that in experienced treaders, both the ‘egg-beater’ and the ‘upright breaststroke’ technique are economic techniques when treading water.",https://osf.io/bruxa/?view_only=ea5c8f5ee0cb44e695649e57264818e2,,https://osf.io/bruxa/?view_only=ea5c8f5ee0cb44e695649e57264818e2,Open Science Framework

How temporal fluctuations in their expression levels bias lineage commitment is unknown. Here we generated knock-in reporter fusion ES cell lines allowing to monitor endogenous SOX2 and OCT4 protein fluctuations in living cells and to determine their impact on mesendodermal and neuroectodermal commitment. We found that small differences in SOX2 and OCT4 levels impact cell fate commitment in G1 but not in S phase. Elevated SOX2 levels modestly increased neuroectodermal commitment and decreased mesendodermal commitment upon directed differentiation. In contrast, elevated OCT4 levels strongly biased ES cells towards both neuroectodermal and mesendodermal fates. Using ATAC-seq on ES cells gated for different endogenous SOX2 and OCT4 levels, we found that high OCT4 levels increased chromatin accessibility at differentiation-associated enhancers. This suggests that small endogenous fluctuations of pioneer transcription factors can bias cell fate decisions by concentration-dependent priming of differentiation-associated enhancers.",GSE126554,2019-09-23,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126554,GEO datasets

We obtained a highly purified population of mitotic mouse embryonic stem cells and compared the genome-wide binding profile of SOX2 to that in asynchronous cells by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), and show that SOX2 remains bound to a small set of genes during mitosis.",GSE89599  ID,2016-11-07,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89599,GEO datasets

196567,94EC1A03-F146-41A8-B3B7-8AD5F44730FC,Wanderful Music: The effect of music on vividness and content of imagined journeys,"Directed, intentional imagination is pivotal for creativity, self-regulation in the form of escapism, and therapies for mental disorders. The latter in particular benefits from increasing our understanding of directed imagination, as well as non-invasive means of influencing imagined content as well as its vividness. To investigate directed imagination, this study draws from the prior observation that music can influence the imagined content during mind-wandering, as well as the finding that relative orientation within time and space is retained in imagination. One hundred participants engaged in a directed imagination task, that required watching a visual inducer in which a figure travels towards a barely visible landmark in the far distance, and then closing their eyes and imagine a continuation of the journey. During each imagined journey, participants either listened to auditory inducers in form of music, or to a silent control condition. After the imagined journeys, participants provided responses about vividness, the imagined time passed and distance travelled, as well as detailed descriptions of the imagined content. Bayesian mixed effects models reveal strong evidence that vividness, sentiment, as well imagined time passed and distances travelled, are systematically influenced based on the auditory inducers, and further show that aspects of these effects can be modelled through features - such as tempo - of the auditory inducer. The results highlight music’s potential to support therapies such as Exposure Therapy and Imagery Rescripting, which deploy directed imagination as a clinical tool for the treatment of mental disorders.",https://osf.io/g6snp/,2021-04-19,https://osf.io/g6snp/,Open Science Framework

In addition to cataloguing biodiversity, these data provide the basis for understanding biological function and evolution. Accurate and complete genome assemblies offer a comprehensive and reliable foundation upon which to advance our understanding of organismal biology at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. However, ever-changing sequencing technologies and analysis methods mean that available data are often heterogeneous in quality. In order to guide forthcoming genome generation efforts and promote efficient prioritisation of resources, it is thus essential to define and monitor taxonomic coverage and quality of the data.Here we present an automated analysis workflow that surveys genome assemblies from the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), assesses their completeness using the relevant Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) datasets, and collates the results into an interactively browsable resource. We apply our workflow to produce a community resource of available assemblies from the phylum Arthropoda, the Arthropoda Assembly Assessment Catalogue. Using this resource, we survey current taxonomic coverage and assembly quality at the NCBI, we examine how key assembly metrics relate to gene content completeness, and we compare results from using different BUSCO lineage datasets.These results demonstrate how the workflow can be used to build a community resource that enables large-scale assessments to survey species coverage and data quality of available genome assemblies, and to guide prioritisations for ongoing and future sampling, sequencing, and genome generation initiatives.",10.5524/100974,2022-01-05,http://gigadb.org/dataset/100974,GigaDB

One of the main challenges is the synthesis of room temperature skyrmion-hosting materials that are compatible with thin-film technology. We present an approach to produce strain-free epitaxial thin films of Co10-xZn10-yMnx+y using molecular beam epitaxy. Bulk Co10-xZn10-yMnx+y is known to host skyrmions at room temperature for specific composition ratios. Our substrate consists of graphene on oxidized silicon. The van der Waals interactions of the grown material with graphene avoids covalent bonding and corresponding strain. We show how defects in the graphene foster nucleation resulting into three different kinds of morphologies: islands, columns and merged films. Susceptibility measurements suggest a phase transition close to room temperature. We detect up to three spin waves resonances suggesting relatively low magnetic damping. This growth technique opens a new route for integrating complex alloys and skyrmionic device concepts with silicon electronics.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4711359,2021-04-26,https://zenodo.org/record/4711359#.YJqXU6HRY2x,Zenodo

The role of Dicer binding partner TRBP in these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we solved the solution structure of the two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) of TRBP in complex with a functionally asymmetric siRNA using NMR, EPR, and single-molecule spectroscopy. We find that siRNA recognition by the dsRBDs is not sequence-specific but rather depends on the RNA shape. The two dsRBDs can swap their binding sites, giving rise to two equally populated, pseudo-symmetrical complexes, showing that TRBP is not a primary sensor of siRNA asymmetry. Using our structure to model a Dicer-TRBP-siRNA ternary complex, we show that TRBP's dsRBDs and Dicer's RNase III domains bind a canonical 19 base pair siRNA on opposite sides, supporting a mechanism whereby TRBP influences Dicer-mediated cleavage accuracy by binding the dsRNA region of the pre-miRNA during Dicer cleavage.",https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5N8M,2018-02-21,https://www.rcsb.org/,RCSB Protein Data Bank

A few additional samples (56) were collected from a parallel cast with a trace-metal rosette, with a bucket, and as duplicates to ensure data quality. All samples were analyzed for their salinity and results are reported on the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78; Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., 1989). Measurements were performed on a Guildline Autosal Laboratory Salinometer 8400(B) at CSIRO (Hobart, Australia) for samples collected during leg 1, and on a OPTIMARE Precision Salinometer (OPS) at the Alfred Wegener Institute (Bremerhaven, Germany) for samples collected during legs 2 and 3. This circumpolar data set provides insights into the hydrological cycle of the Southern Ocean and the processes (precipitation, evaporation, sea-ice melting and freezing, ice-berg and land-ice melting) that determine the salinity of a certain water mass.

190865,84FA4C27-675A-452B-BBF7-D76D0C24711E,Engineering ‘smart’ viral RNA structures for stable and targeted siRNA delivery,"Innovative delivery strategies are needed in order to realize the potential of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in medicine. SiRNAs are short, double-stranded RNA molecules that silence genes by co-opting an endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Because they act on messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences via RNAi, siRNAs hold promise as potentially curative therapies for genetic defects, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and other diseases that cannot be treated with traditional, protein-binding small molecule drugs and biologics. However, key physiological barriers largely have precluded the translation of siRNA drugs into clinical practice. In vivo, naked siRNAs are degraded rapidly by nucleases and cleared by the kidneys, resulting in a half-life of less than five minutes. Moreover, by comparison to small molecule drugs, siRNA drugs are relatively large, hydrophilic molecules that do not distribute widely to tissues or passively cross the cell membrane. Therefore, without an effective strategy for delivery, the accumulation of siRNA drugs at target sites is minimal. Today, there are few prominent siRNA delivery approaches, and each has significant limitations. For example, chemical modifications can improve nuclease resistance, but with the increase in stability also come tradeoffs in potency and safety. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) physically shield siRNAs from degradation and can be modified to promote biodistribution and uptake; but as LNPs are optimized for efficacy, they become increasingly complex, posing quality assurance, cost, and evaluation problems. Finally, conjugation to the N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand is a promising delivery strategy for the liver, but targeted delivery to other tissues is a problem that still remains to be solved. Advances in nucleic acid nanotechnology have shown that RNA is an emerging platform for drug delivery. In particular, a three-way junction (3WJ) derived from bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA) has gained prominence as a vector for small molecule, microRNA (miRNA), anti-miRNA, and siRNA delivery. As a delivery solution for siRNA, RNA-based platforms like the pRNA 3WJ have many notable advantages. For example, size and shape can be controlled to minimize clearance, and functionalization with aptamers can drive cell uptake. Also, RNA is a fundamentally biocompatible molecule that is simple, straightforward to produce, and multifunctional. However, its metabolic instability is limiting. Exciting new research has uncovered ‘smart’ RNA structures that are produced by flaviviruses (e.g., Zika, Dengue, West Nile) to thwart nuclease degradation. Compared to other RNA structures used for drug delivery, these nuclease-resistant structures (NRSs) may be uniquely positioned for in vivo applications. The aim of this project is to harness the inherent stability of flaviviral NRSs in the creation of a supramolecular platform for siRNA delivery. This project has the potential to address a critical need in the field of oligonucleotide therapeutics, which has few promising solutions for harnessing the power of RNAi in the clinic. Additionally, this project will validate new stable structures as building blocks for use in RNA nanotechnology and therefore will help researchers design supramolecular structures for a variety of applications well beyond those described in this proposal.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.x95x69phd,2021-02-09,https://datadryad.org/stash/share/m6-vDbqCBZUjSN8FwMa0gmz3hWNv9_JvYT3511NsUNw,Dryad Digital Repository

All data is provided in NetCDF format. The data set contains 3 sets 40-year long model spin-up, control, and 3 perturbation simulations each. The sets differ by their model mean state to assess the effect of surface salinity biases on the results. One set of simulations are reference simulations where salinity is restored to the observed surface salinity during model spin-up, and the other two sets are simulations in which the restoring surface salinity has been altered by plus and minus 0.1 PSU, respectively. The control and perturbation simulations are 40-year extensions of the respective model spin-up simulations. In the perturbation simulations either the surface freshwater fluxes or momentum fluxes are instantaneously perturbed after the spin-up simulation to reflect the observation-derived changes in these surface fluxes and then held constant (at the perturbed level) for 40 years. They consist of sea-ice freshwater flux, glacial meltwater flux, and atmosphere-ocean momentum flux changes. Details on the model setup, forcing, and simulations can be obtained from the related research article by Haumann et al.

Data was collected continuously except for periods when the pump of the underway system was switched off or the system was turned off. Data collection covers all three cruise legs in the period 24th December 2016 to 18th March 2017. Data collected with the CTG MiniPack CTD-F are temperature, salinity, pressure, and turbidity. Data collected by the Aanderaa oxygen optode include dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation. An SBE 18 sensor measured pH. The CTG UniLux fluorometer measured chlorophyll-a concentration. All data has been quality controlled and post-cruise calibrated. Data is provided at 1-minute intervals along the cruise track.

The associated probabilities and cost-benefit ratios may vary systematically between the sexes, which often display different dispersal strategies and interaction patterns. Whereas female Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, are known to apply direct and generalized decision rules of reciprocal cooperation, the rules according to which males reciprocate favours are less well understood. Therefore, we investigated the cooperation propensity of male wild-type Norway rats. Male test rats experienced cooperating partners that provided food to them, or defecting partners that refused to provide help. Afterwards, test rats could donate food to previously experienced or unknown partners, resembling direct and generalized reciprocity paradigms, respectively. Male rats cooperated according to direct reciprocity, suggesting that this decision rule is similarly important for both sexes. However, whereas females additionally help according to generalized reciprocity, males did not apply this rule. These results suggest a sex difference in reciprocal decision rules, highlighting the potential importance of different interaction patterns and cost-benefit ratios between the sexes.",https://doi.org/10.17630/971c173d-9ef9-4783-9a65-1d2c4cfc2a8a,2020-05-18,https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/male-rats-cooperate-according-to-direct-reciprocity-but-not-to-generalised-reciprocity-dataset(971c173d-9ef9-4783-9a65-1d2c4cfc2a8a).html,"PURE, St Andrews"

The addition of AREs resulted in elevated respirationacross all soil types. Bacterial and fungal alphadiversity decreased significantly, coinciding withstrong shifts in microbial community structure inARE-treated soils. These shifts in bacterial communitystructure were driven by an increased abundanceof fast-growing copiotrophic taxa. Fungalcommunities were predominantly affected by AREsin SE active layer soils and shifted towards fastgrowingopportunistic yeast. In contrast, in the colderNW facing active layer and permafrost soils fungalcommunities were more influenced by temperaturechanges.

Here, westudy how climatic variables, vegetation, parent material, soil properties, and slopeaspect affect the soil microbiome on 10 GLORIA (Global Observation Research Initiativein Alpine environments) mountain summits ranging from the lower alpine to the nival zonein Switzerland. At these summits we sampled soils from all four aspects and examinedhow the bacterial and fungal communities vary by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing.We found that mountain summit soils contain highly diverse microbial communities witha total of 10,406 bacterial and 6,291 fungal taxa. Bacterial a-diversity increased withincreasing soil pH and decreased with increasing elevation, whereas fungal a-diversitydid not change significantly. Soil pH was the strongest predictor for microbial b-diversity.Bacterial and fungal community structures exhibited a significant positive relationshipwith plant communities, indicating that summits with a more distinct plant compositionalso revealed more distinct microbial communities. The influence of elevation wasstronger than aspect on the soil microbiome. Several microbial taxa responded toelevation and soil pH. Chloroflexi and Mucoromycota were significantly more abundanton summits at higher elevations, whereas the relative abundance of Basidiomycotaand Agaricomycetes decreased with elevation. Most bacterial OTUs belonging to thephylum Acidobacteria were indicators for siliceous parent material and several OTUsbelonging to the phylum Planctomycetes were associated with calcareous soils. Thetrends for fungi were less clear. Indicator OTUs belonging to the genera Mortierella andNaganishia showed a mixed response to parent material, demonstrating their ubiquitousand opportunistic behaviour in soils. Overall, fungal communities responded weakly toabiotic and biotic factors. In contrast, bacterial communities were strongly influencedby environmental changes suggesting they will be strongly affected by future climatechange and associated temperature increase and an upward migration of vegetation.Our results provide the first insights into the soil microbiome of mountain summits inthe European Alps that are shaped as a result of highly variable local environmentalconditions and may help to predict responses of the soil biota to global climate change.",PRJNA509562,2018-12-12,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA509562,NCBI Sequence Read Archive

In addition to cataloguing biodiversity, these data provide the basis for understanding biological function and evolution. Accurate and complete genome assemblies offer a comprehensive and reliable foundation upon which to advance our understanding of organismal biology at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. However, ever-changing sequencing technologies and analysis methods mean that available data are often heterogeneous in quality. In order to guide forthcoming genome generation efforts and promote efficient prioritisation of resources, it is thus essential to define and monitor taxonomic coverage and quality of the data.Here we present an automated analysis workflow that surveys genome assemblies from the United States National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), assesses their completeness using the relevant Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) datasets, and collates the results into an interactively browsable resource. We apply our workflow to produce a community resource of available assemblies from the phylum Arthropoda, the Arthropoda Assembly Assessment Catalogue. Using this resource, we survey current taxonomic coverage and assembly quality at the NCBI, we examine how key assembly metrics relate to gene content completeness, and we compare results from using different BUSCO lineage datasets.These results demonstrate how the workflow can be used to build a community resource that enables large-scale assessments to survey species coverage and data quality of available genome assemblies, and to guide prioritisations for ongoing and future sampling, sequencing, and genome generation initiatives.",10.5524/100974,2022-01-05,http://gigadb.org/dataset/100974,GigaDB

In this study, we determined the signature of CXCR3+ Treg cells arising in Th1 settings and defined universal features of Treg cells in this context using multiple Th1-dominated models. Our analysis defined a set of Th1-specific co-inhibitory receptors that are specifically expressed in Treg cells during Th1 immune responses.

Here we apply single cell transcriptomics to unravel the program inducing sexual differentiation in Plasmodium falciparum. Parasites have to make this essential life-cycle decision in preparation for human-to-mosquito transmission.Methods: By combining transcriptional profiling with quantitative imaging and genetics, we defined a transcriptional signature in sexually committed cells.Results: We found this transcriptional signature to be distinct from general changes in parasite metabolism that can be observed in response to commitment-inducing conditions.Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study provides a template to capture transcriptional diversity in parasite populations containing complex mixtures of different life-cycle stages and developmental programs, with important implications for our understanding of parasite biology and the ongoing malaria elimination campaign.",10.17605/OSF.IO/QMXVZ,2018-05-31,https://osf.io/qmxvz/,OSF

Here we investigate whether antimalarial agents with novel mechanisms of action could be discovered using a diverse collection of synthetic compounds that have three-dimensional features reminiscent of natural products and are underrepresented in typical screening collections. We report the identification of such compounds with both previously reported and undescribed mechanisms of action, including a series of bicyclic azetidines that inhibit a new antimalarial target, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. These molecules are curative in mice at a single, low dose and show activity against all parasite life stages in multiple in vivo efficacy models. Our findings identify bicyclic azetidines with the potential to both cure and prevent transmission of the disease as well as protect at-risk populations with a single oral dose, highlighting the strength of diversity-oriented synthesis in revealing promising therapeutic targets.",10.1038/nature19804,2016-10-01,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP064988 / https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures/search?access=referee&ccdc=1429949&authors=Kato,Sequence Read Archive / Cambridge Structural Database

The role of Dicer binding partner TRBP in these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we solved the solution structure of the two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) of TRBP in complex with a functionally asymmetric siRNA using NMR, EPR, and single-molecule spectroscopy. We find that siRNA recognition by the dsRBDs is not sequence-specific but rather depends on the RNA shape. The two dsRBDs can swap their binding sites, giving rise to two equally populated, pseudo-symmetrical complexes, showing that TRBP is not a primary sensor of siRNA asymmetry. Using our structure to model a Dicer-TRBP-siRNA ternary complex, we show that TRBP's dsRBDs and Dicer's RNase III domains bind a canonical 19 base pair siRNA on opposite sides, supporting a mechanism whereby TRBP influences Dicer-mediated cleavage accuracy by binding the dsRNA region of the pre-miRNA during Dicer cleavage.",https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5N8L,2018-02-21,https://www.rcsb.org,RCSB Protein Data Bank

177859,5A14C091-FC58-42BD-9730-0F446A14CCB3,Structure of a DNA retention-prone PCNA variant,"AbstractProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a sliding clamp that acts as a central co-ordinator for mismatch repair (MMR) as well as DNA replication. Loss of Elg1, the major subunit of the PCNA unloader complex, causes over-accumulation of PCNA on DNA and also increases mutation rate, but it has been unclear if the two effects are linked. Here we show that timely removal of PCNA from DNA by the Elg1 complex is important to prevent mutations. Although premature unloading of PCNA generally increases mutation rate, the mutator phenotype of elg1Δ is attenuated by PCNA mutants PCNA-R14E and PCNA-D150E that spontaneously fall off DNA. In contrast, the elg1Δ mutator phenotype is exacerbated by PCNA mutants that accumulate on DNA due to enhanced electrostatic PCNA-DNA interactions. Epistasis analysis suggests that PCNA over-accumulation on DNA interferes with both MMR and MMR-independent process(es). In elg1Δ, over-retained PCNA hyper-recruits the Msh2-Msh6 mismatch recognition complex through its PCNA-interacting peptide motif, causing accumulation of MMR intermediates. Our results suggest that PCNA retention controlled by the Elg1 complex is critical for efficient MMR: PCNA needs to be on DNA long enough to enable MMR, but if it is retained too long it interferes with downstream repair steps.",6D0R,2019-07-26,http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&qrid=9652185D,RCSB PDB

Such subsidy couplings between ecosystems have important landscape-scale implications because perturbations in one ecosystem may affect community structure and functioning in neighbouring ecosystems via increased/decreased subsidies. Here, we combine a general theoretical approach based on harvesting theory and a two-patch protist meta-ecosystem experiment to test the effect of regional perturbations on local community dynamics. We first characterized the relationship between the perturbation regime and local population demography on detritus production using a mathematical model. We then experimentally simulated a perturbation gradient affecting connected ecosystems simultaneously, thus altering cross-ecosystem subsidy exchanges. We demonstrate that the perturbation regime can interact with local population dynamics to trigger unexpected temporal variations in subsidy pulses from one ecosystem to another. High perturbation intensity initially led to the highest level of subsidy flows; however, the level of perturbation interacted with population dynamics to generate a crash in subsidy exchange over time. Both theoretical and experimental results show that a perturbation regime interacting with local community dynamics can induce a collapse in population levels for recipient ecosystems. These results call for integrative management of human-altered landscapes that takes into account regional dynamics of both species and resource flows.",10.5061/dryad.hm041,2016-08-24,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.hm041,Dryad

Movement and dispersal are critical processes for almost all organisms in natural populations. Understanding their causes and consequences is therefore of high interest. While both theoretical and empirical work suggests that dispersal, more exactly emigration, is plastic and may be a function of local population density, the functional relationship between the underlying movement strategies and population density has received less attention. 2. We here present evidence for the shape of this reaction norm and are able to differentiate between three possible cues: the relative number of individuals, the presence of metabolites (chemical cues) and resource availability. 3. We performed microcosm experiments with the ciliate model organism Tet-rahymena in order to understand the plasticity of movement strategies with respect to local density while controlling for possible confounding effects mediated by the availability of different cues. In addition, we investigated how an Allee effect can influence movement and dispersal plasticity. 4. Our findings suggest that movement strategies in Tetrahymena are plastic and density-dependent. The observed movement reaction norm was ushaped. This may be due to an Allee effect which led to negative densitydependence at low population densities and generally positive density-dependence at high population densities due to local competition. This possibly adaptive density-dependent movement strategy was likely mediated by chemical cues. 5. Our experimental work in highly controlled conditions indicates that both environmental cues as well as inherent population dynamics must be considered to understand movement and dispersal.",10.5061/dryad.383q4,2015-10-31,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.383q4,Dryad

Stringent abiotic factors select for convergent adaptations, such as loss of eyes and pigments, while interspecific competition drives between-species divergence. Subterranean species can resolve opposing selection by adaptation to physically different microhabitats. Yet, species frequently co-occur in physically homogeneous subterranean habitats, like interstitial. These co-occurrences in such a narrow ecological context can be explained either by equalizing mechanisms, in which neither of the co-occurring species has a competitive advantage, or by more complex niche models that include species’ differentiation along a trophic niche axis. We tested these hypotheses using the amphipod genus Niphargus. We analysed Europe-wide co-occurrence records of Niphargus species from interstitial habitats, split into six independent large-scale regions. Firstly, we addressed whether species’ pairwise co-occurrences are random using a probabilistic model. Secondly, we tested whether species cluster into distinct functional-morphological groups and whether ecologically or phylogenetically distinct species are more likely to co-occur. We found that 68 % of species co-occurrences were not different from random expectation, indicating that most species had access to most sites within each region. The remaining 32 % co-occurred either significantly more or less often than expected by chance. Cluster analysis of functional morphological characters showed that interstitial species belong to two feeding types, micro- and macrofeeders, likely representing two peaks of the interstitial adaptive landscape, and hinting that niche divergence, as a mechanism allowing coexistence, is favoured. Finally, we found that the number of co-occurrences increases with increasing differentiation of functional morphology, but not phylogenetic differences. We conclude that ecological differentiation may be important in shaping such interstitial communities.",10.5061/dryad.kd3g03r,2019-01-23,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.kd3g03r,Dryad

Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has recognized the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures, because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions. 2. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However, the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework. 3. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population densities, and movement behavior of the protist model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and individual-level movement behavior of thousands of individuals over time. 4. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks, population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged from the different network topologies per se. These differences in population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement. 5. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in natural river systems exhibit strong spatio-temporal patterns in population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective habitat network structure.",10.5061/dryad.4588p,2018-05-18,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.4588p,Dryad

Sexual differentiation is essential for this process, as only sexual parasites, called gametocytes, are infective to the mosquito vector. Gametocyte production rates vary depending on environmental conditions, but external stimuli remain obscure. Here, we show that the host-derived lipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) controls P. falciparum cell fate by repressing parasite sexual differentiation. We demonstrate that exogenous LysoPC drives biosynthesis of the essential membrane component phosphatidylcholine. LysoPC restriction induces a compensatory response, linking parasite metabolism to the activation of sexual-stage-specific transcription and gametocyte formation. Our results reveal that malaria parasites can sense and process host-derived physiological signals to regulate differentiation. These data close a critical knowledge gap in parasite biology and introduce a major component of the sexual differentiation pathway in Plasmodium that may provide new approaches for blocking malaria transmission.",200104114,2017-12-14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104114,Gene Expression Omnibus

Little is known about NEC pathophysiology apart from the presence of pre-event gut dysbiosis. Here, we applied broad range metabolomics to stools obtained 1-5 days before NEC developed from 9 cases (9 samples) and 19 (32 samples) controls matched for gestational age at birth and birth weight. The 764 identified metabolites identified six pathways that differ between cases and controls. We pursued sphingolipid metabolism because cases had decreased ceramides and increased sphingomyelins compared to controls, and because of the relevance of sphingolipids to human inflammatory disorders. Targeted analysis of samples from 23 cases and 46 controls confirmed the initial broad range observations. While metabolites provided only 73% accuracy of classification by machine learning, hierarchical clustering defined a sphingolipid associated grouping that contained 60% of the cases but only 13% of the controls, possibly identifying a pathophysiologically distinct subset of NEC. The clustering did not associate with any of the analyzed clinical and sample variables. We conclude that there are significant changes in sphingolipid metabolism components in pre-NEC stools compared to controls, but our data urge circumspection before using sphingolipids as broadly applicable predictive biomarkers.",30030452,2018-07-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6054655/,PMC

Besides the direct contribution of dispersal to population dynamics, dispersers often differ in their phenotypic attributes from non-dispersers, which leads to dispersal syndromes. The consequences of such dispersal syndromes have been widely explored at the population and community level, however, to date, ecosystem-level effects remain unclear. Here, we examine whether dispersing and resident individuals of two different aquatic keystone invertebrate species have different contributions to detrital processing, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. Using experimental two-patch systems, we found no difference in leaf consumption rates with dispersal status of the common native species Gammarus fossarum. In Dikerogammarus villosus, however, a Ponto-Caspian species now expanding throughout Europe, dispersers consumed leaf litter at roughly three times the rate of non-dispersers. Furthermore, this put the contribution of dispersing D. villosus to leaf litter processing on par with native G. fossarum, after adjusting for differences in organismal size. Given that leaf litter decomposition is a key function in aquatic ecosystems, and the rapid species turnover in freshwater habitats with range expansions of non-native species, this finding suggests that dispersal syndromes may have important consequences for ecosystem functioning.",10.5061/dryad.8b9j040,2019-02-18,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8b9j040,Dryad

Many ecosystem functions are only measured at local scales, while their effects occur at a landscape level. Here, we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem function depend on intraspecific competition, a fine-scale process, by manipulating intraspecific density of shredding macroinvertebrates and examining effects on leaf litter decomposition, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. For two species, we found that per-capita leaf processing rates declined with increasing density following power functions with negative exponents, likely due to interference competition. To demonstrate consequences of this nonlinearity, we scaled up estimates of leaf litter processing from shredder abundance surveys in 10 replicated headwater streams. In accordance with Jensen’s inequality, applying density-dependent consumption rates reduced estimates of catchment-scale leaf consumption by an order of magnitude relative to density-independent rates. Density-dependent consumption estimates aligned closely with metabolic requirements in catchments with large, but not small, shredder populations. Importantly, shredder abundance was not limited by leaf litter availability and catchment-level leaf litter supply was much higher than estimated consumption. Thus leaf litter processing was not limited by resource supply. Our work highlights the need for scaling-up which accounts for intraspecific interactions.",10.5061/dryad.3124p62,2020-09-16,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.3124p62,Dryad

As a spatial process, range expansions are driven by dispersal and movement behaviour. While it is widely accepted that dispersal and movement may be context-dependent, for instance density-dependent, and best represented by reaction norms, the evolution of density-dependent movement during range expansions has received little experimental attention. We therefore tested current theory predicting the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation. Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density-dependent movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of increased intra-strain competitive ability and concurrently decreased population growth rates in range cores. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding movement and dispersal as evolving reaction norms and plastic life-history traits of central relevance for range expansions, biological invasions and the dynamics of spatially structured systems in general.",10.5061/dryad.36q03,2017-09-26,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.36q03,Dryad

Importantly, spatial dynamics can be deeply affected by rapid evolution depending on the ecological context. Using experimental evolution in replicated microcosm landscapes and numerical analyses we show experimentally that the ecological process of range expansions leads to the evolution of increased dispersal. This evolutionary change counter-intuitively feeds back on (macro-)ecological patterns affecting the spatial distribution of population densities. While existing theory suggests that densities decrease from range cores to range margins due to K-selection, we show the reverse to be true when competition is considered explicitly including resource dynamics. We suggest that a dispersal-foraging trade-off, leading to more ‘prudent’ foraging at range margins, is the driving mechanism behind the macroecological pattern reported. In conclusion, rapid multi-trait evolution and eco-evolutionary feedbacks are highly relevant for understanding macroecological patterns and designing appropriate conservation strategies.",10.5061/dryad.6246r,2016-02-16,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6246r,Dryad

This aforementioned CRF01_AE sampled in NSW, were combined with those sampled globally to identify NSW-specific viral clades. The population growth of these clades was assessed in two-year period intervals from 2009 to 2017. Overall, 109 NSW-specific clades were identified, most comprising pairs of sequences; however, five large clades comprising ≥10 sequences were also found. Forty-four clades grew over time with one or two sequences added to each in different two-year periods. Importantly, while 10 of these clades have seemingly discontinued, the remaining 34 were still active in 2016/2017. Seven such clades each comprised ≥10 sequences, and are representative of individual sub-epidemics in NSW.

By assessing genome-wide heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) occupancy, we present a comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin landscapes across different Plasmodium species, strains, and life cycle stages. Common targets of epigenetic silencing include fast-evolving multi-gene families encoding surface antigens and a small set of conserved HP1-associated genes with regulatory potential. Many P. falciparum heterochromatic genes are marked in a strain-specific manner, increasing the parasite's adaptive capacity. Whereas heterochromatin is strictly maintained during mitotic proliferation of asexual blood stage parasites, substantial heterochromatin reorganization occurs in differentiating gametocytes and appears crucial for the activation of key gametocyte-specific genes and adaptation of erythrocyte remodeling machinery.

We show for a subset of these families that eDNA samples overcome spatial autocorrelation biases associated with the classical community assessments by integrating biodiversity information over space. In addition, we demonstrate that many terrestrial species are detected; thus suggesting eDNA in river water also incorporates biodiversity information across terrestrial and aquatic biomes.

At the same time, range dynamics feed back and may select for increased dispersal at expanding range fronts. This interplay between macroecological and evolutionary dynamics happens almost universally across environmental gradients and such gradients can have a direct impact on the fitness of organisms due to the match or mismatch between an individual's environmental optimum and the current conditions along the gradient. Importantly, gradients also provide individuals with information on environmental changes because dispersing individuals may sense whether environmental conditions improve or deteriorate. However, the ability of organisms to use this information on the environment and to subsequently adjust dispersal decisions plastically, that is, deciding to further disperse into the gradient or not, has been largely ignored and the macroecological consequences remain unclear.

Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed.

However, previous comparative and experimental work on dendritic metacommunities has studied diversity mostly from an equilibrium perspective. Here we investigated the effect of dendritic versus linear network structure on local (α-diversity), among (β-diversity) and total (γ-diversity) temporal species community diversity dynamics. Using a combination of microcosm experiments, which allowed for active dispersal of 14 protists and a rotifer species, and numerical analyses, we demonstrate the general importance of spatial network configuration and basic life history tradeoffs as driving factors of different diversity patterns in linear and dendritic systems. We experimentally found that community diversity patterns were shaped by the interaction of dispersal within the networks and local species interactions. Specifically, α-diversity remained higher in dendritic networks over time, especially at highly connected sites. β-diversity was initially greater in linear networks, due to increased dispersal limitation, but became more similar to β-diversity in dendritic networks over time. Comparing the experimental results with a neutral metacommunity model we found that dispersal and network connectivity alone may, to a large extent, explain α- and β-diversity dynamics. However, additional mechanisms, such as variation in carrying capacity and competition-colonization tradeoffs, were needed in the model to capture the detailed temporal diversity dynamics of the experiments, such as a general decline in γ-diversity and long-term dynamics in α-diversity.",10.5061/dryad.1kf36,2016-06-23,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1kf36,Dryad

However, eDNA capture and extraction protocols vary widely across studies. This use of different protocols potentially biases detection results and could significantly hinder a reliable use of eDNA to detect biodiversity. We tested whether choice of eDNA capture and extraction protocols significantly influenced biodiversity detection in aquatic systems. We sampled lake and river water, captured and extracted eDNA using six combinations of different protocols with replication, and tested for the detection of four macroinvertebrate species. Additionally, using the same lake water technical replicates, we compared the effect of capture and extraction protocols on metabarcode detections of biodiversity using 16S for eubacteria and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) for eukaryotes. Protocol combinations for capture and extraction of eDNA significantly influenced DNA yield and number of sequences obtained from next generation sequencing. We found significantly different detection rates of species ranging from zero percent to thirty-three percent. Differences in which protocol combinations produced the highest metabarcoded biodiversity were detected and demonstrate that different protocols are required for different biodiversity targets. Our results highlight that the choice of molecular protocols used for capture and extraction of eDNA from water can strongly affect biodiversity detection. Consideration of biases caused by choice of protocols should lead to a more consistent and reliable molecular workflow for repeatable and increased detection of biodiversity in aquatic communities.",10.5061/dryad.7q19c,2015-11-18,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7q19c,Dryad

177859,E06C6C13-3655-452C-8403-8C1C3362BCFC,Structure of a DNA retention-prone PCNA variant,"AbstractProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a sliding clamp that acts as a central co-ordinator for mismatch repair (MMR) as well as DNA replication. Loss of Elg1, the major subunit of the PCNA unloader complex, causes over-accumulation of PCNA on DNA and also increases mutation rate, but it has been unclear if the two effects are linked. Here we show that timely removal of PCNA from DNA by the Elg1 complex is important to prevent mutations. Although premature unloading of PCNA generally increases mutation rate, the mutator phenotype of elg1Δ is attenuated by PCNA mutants PCNA-R14E and PCNA-D150E that spontaneously fall off DNA. In contrast, the elg1Δ mutator phenotype is exacerbated by PCNA mutants that accumulate on DNA due to enhanced electrostatic PCNA-DNA interactions. Epistasis analysis suggests that PCNA over-accumulation on DNA interferes with both MMR and MMR-independent process(es). In elg1Δ, over-retained PCNA hyper-recruits the Msh2-Msh6 mismatch recognition complex through its PCNA-interacting peptide motif, causing accumulation of MMR intermediates. Our results suggest that PCNA retention controlled by the Elg1 complex is critical for efficient MMR: PCNA needs to be on DNA long enough to enable MMR, but if it is retained too long it interferes with downstream repair steps.",6D0Q,2019-07-26,http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/results/results.do?tabtoshow=Current&qrid=9652185D,RCSB PDB

However, their efficient excitation via microwave fields is still a challenge. Current methods including nanocontacts and grating couplers require advanced nanofabrication tools which limit the broad usage. Here we report efficient emission and detection of exchange magnons using micron-sized coplanar waveguides (CPWs) into which we integrated ferromagnetic(m) layers. We excited magnons in a broad frequency band with wavelengths λ down to 100 nm propagating over macroscopic distances in thin yttrium iron garnet. Applying time- and spatially resolved Brillouin light scattering as well as micromagnetic simulations we evidence a significant wavelength conversion process near mCPWs via tunable inhomogeneous fields. We argue that optimized mCPWs form microwave-to-magnon transducers providing phase-coherent exchange magnons with  down to below 40 nm. Without any nanofabrication they allow one to harvest the advantages of nanomagnonics by antenna designs exploited in conventional microwave circuits.",DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3633075,2020-01-31,https://zenodo.org/record/3633075#.XnNgaBco_Fx,zenodo

179089,E9D8B03E-9B25-4F7D-8E13-1132BF3A0553,Differential resource consumption in leaf litter mixtures by native and non-native amphipods,"Leaf litter processing is an essential ecosystem function in freshwater systems, since much of the carbon and nutrients moving through freshwater food webs come from the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, it is important to understand how the species performing this function differ, especially because many native species are being replaced by non-native species in aquatic ecosystems. We used a field experiment to examine leaf consumption rates of two common shredding macroinvertebrates (the native Gammarus fossarum and the non-native Gammarus roeselii). Leaves from three species, varying in resource quality, were added both in leaf monocultures and as a three-species mixture. Biomass-adjusted daily consumption rates were similar between the two amphipod species, and each consumed nitrogen-rich alder leaves faster than oak or beech leaves. However, because adult G. roeselii are approximately twice the size of G. fossarum, this led to systematic, though nonsignificant, differences in consumption rates at the per-capita or population level. Furthermore, we found nuanced effects of decomposer identity on leaf decomposition in mixtures. Only G. roeselii showeding increased consumption of the preferred resource (alder) in the mixture, while G. fossarum consumed all leaves at the same proportional rates as in monocultures. This is an important distinction, as most measures of macroinvertebrate leaf shredding are made in the laboratory with only a single leaf resource available. Our results, based on a field experiment which could control the presence of dominant macroinvertebrates while still providing natural, biologically realistic context, suggests that even functionally-similar species may subtly shift ecosystem processes.",10.5061/dryad.v22901d,2019-02-15,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.v22901d,Dryad

Example : Marc tells Mary that July is beautiful.Here Marc and Mary are the only involved characters    A type : the type defines if the narrative act is an action about an action (AA), an action about a state (AS), a state about an action (SA) or a state about a state (SS)    A sequence position : the sequence position corresponds to the position of the principal action related to the secondary action. It can be before, during or after.    A level of abstraction : this attribute corresponds to the complexity of the sentence.    Valence : valence is a linguistic characteristic of a verb. It corresponds to the number of elements that are connected to that verb. The element can be active or passive. A verb can be avalent (for example : to rain) and it can have a different valence according to how it is used (for example : He gives a gift (v=1). He gives a gift to her (v=2))    A domain and a Class : a narrative act is classified in domains and classes.",10.5281/zenodo.1557620,2018-11-27,https://zenodo.org/record/1557620#.XhNsuOtCfRY,Zenodo

In this case study, we investigated spontaneous and repeated social tool use behavior in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We presented a group of chimpanzees with an apparatus, in which pushing two buttons would release juice from a distantly located fountain. Consequently, any one individual could only either push the buttons or drink from the fountain but never push and drink simultaneously. In this scenario, an adult male attempted to retrieve three other individuals and push them toward the buttons that, if pressed, released juice from the fountain. With this strategy, the social tool user increased his juice intake 10-fold. Interestingly, the strategy was stable over time, which was possibly enabled by playing with the social tools. With over 100 instances, we provide the biggest data set on social tool use recorded among nonhuman animals so far. The repeated use of other individuals as social tools may represent a complex social skill linked to Machiavellian intelligence.",https://doi.org/10.17630/beac8dda-dbf3-4f17-9b3e-260d1a0fde92,2020-05-18,https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/spontaneous-social-tool-use-in-a-chimpanzee-dataset(beac8dda-dbf3-4f17-9b3e-260d1a0fde92).html,"PURE, St Andrews"

Still, the evolutionary origin is largely unclear, partly because it is believed that our closest living relatives, other primates, do not reciprocate help. Consequently, reciprocity is suggested to have evolved in the human linage only. However, our systematic review of studies investigating reciprocity in non-human primates revealed that, contrary to common perception, there are more positive than negative findings in both experimental and observational studies. Furthermore, we argue that negative findings can provide important insights. We found that reciprocity is not confined to unrelated individuals. In addition, reciprocity can be influenced by the choice of experimental design, relationship quality, social services and temporal scales. Thus, negative findings should not be used as evidence of no reciprocity but as the building blocks for a more comprehensive theory. Based on our review, we conclude that reciprocity in primates is present but underestimated. We close by suggesting further steps that could pave the way for future research aimed at understanding the evolutionary origins of reciprocity.",10.17630/92fb3b2b-85a5-4c9f-ae80-e29b61740b18,2019-07-07,https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/revisiting-the-possibility-of-reciprocal-help-in-nonhuman-primates(92fb3b2b-85a5-4c9f-ae80-e29b61740b18).html,"PURE, St Andrews"

With this contribution, we describe and publish two high-quality street-level datasets, captured with a portable high-performance Mobile Mapping System (MMS). The datasets will be freely available for scientific use. Both datasets, from a city centre and a forest represent area-wide street-level reality captures which can be used e.g. for establishing cloud-based frameworks for infrastructure management as well as for smart city and forestry applications. The quality of these data sets has been thoroughly evaluated and demonstrated. For example, georeferencing accuracies in the centimetre range using these datasets in combination with image-based georeferencing have been achieved. Both high-quality multi sensor system street-level datasets are suitable for evaluating and improving methods for multiple tasks related to high-precision 3D reality capture and the creation of digital twins. Potential applications range from localization and georeferencing, dense image matching and 3D reconstruction to combined methods such as simultaneous localization and mapping and structure-from-motion as well as classification and scene interpretation.

However, its competitiveness against SNP arrays is undermined as current imputation methods are computationally expensive and unable to leverage large reference panels.Here, we describe a method, GLIMPSE, for phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing datasets from modern reference panels. We demonstrate its remarkable performance across different coverages and human populations. It achieves imputation of a full genome for less than $1, outperforming existing methods by orders of magnitude, with an increased accuracy of more than 20% at rare variants. We also show that 1x coverage enables effective association studies and is better suited than dense SNP arrays to access the impact of rare variations. Overall, this study demonstrates the promising potential of low-coverage imputation and suggests a paradigm shift in the design of future genomic studies.",10.5281/zenodo.4078748,2020-10-11,https://github.com/odelaneau/GLIMPSE,GLIMPSE

To translate these into a widespread technology, attaining ultralow optical losses with established foundry manufacturing is critical. Recent advances in integrated Si 3 N 4 photonics have shown that ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered microresonators with quality factors Q > 10 × 10 6 can be attained at die-level throughput. Yet, current fabrication techniques do not have sufficiently high yield and performance for existing and emerging applications, such as integrated travelling-wave parametric amplifiers that require meter-long photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate a fabrication technology that meets all requirements on wafer-level yield, performance and length scale. Photonic microresonators with a mean Q factor exceeding 30 × 10 6 , corresponding to 1.0 dB m −1 optical loss, are obtained over full 4-inch wafers, as determined from a statistical analysis of tens of thousands of optical resonances, and confirmed via cavity ringdown with 19 ns photon storage time. The process operates over large areas with high yield, enabling 1-meter-long spiral waveguides with 2.4 dB m −1 loss in dies of only 5 × 5 mm 2 size. Using a response measurement self-calibrated via the Kerr nonlinearity, we reveal that the intrinsic absorption-limited Q factor of our Si 3 N 4 microresonators can exceed 2 × 10 8 . This absorption loss is sufficiently low such that the Kerr nonlinearity dominates the microresonator’s response even in the audio frequency band. Transferring this Si 3 N 4 technology to commercial foundries can significantly improve the performance and capabilities of integrated photonics.",10.5281/zenodo.4273990,2021-12-16,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4273990,ZENODO
175269,AF27D896-ECC6-4B70-A1DF-5EE3E0F0F859,Rats play tit-for-tat instead of integrating cooperative experiences over multiple interactions,"Theoretical models of cooperation typically assume that agents use simple rules based on last encounters, such as ‘tit-for-tat’, to reciprocate help. By contrast, empiricists generally suppose that animals integrate multiple experiences over longer timespans. Here, we compared these two alternative hypotheses by exposing Norway rats to partners that cooperated on three consecutive days but failed to cooperate on the fourth day, and to partners that did the exact opposite. In additional controls, focal rats experienced cooperating and defecting partners only once. In a bar-pulling setup, focal rats based their decision to provide partners with food on last encounters instead of overall cooperation levels. To check whether this might be owing to a lack of memory capacity, we tested whether rats remember the outcome of encounters that had happened three days before. Cooperation was not diminished by the intermediate time interval. We conclude that rats reciprocate help mainly based on most recent encounters instead of integrating social experience over longer timespans.",https://doi.org/10.17630/20046e0b-4d00-483d-a406-dffe0b14e46d,2020-01-15,https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/datasets/rats-play-titfortat-instead-of-integrating-cooperative-experiences-over-multiple-interactions-dataset(20046e0b-4d00-483d-a406-dffe0b14e46d).html,"PURE, St Andrews"

184024,8EF4A77E-6C96-428C-B2DE-52843F1673A5,"Novel contact sites between lipid droplets, early endosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum","Lipid droplets (LDs) play a crucial role in the storage and distribution of lipids to control cellular metabolism and bioenergetics (1). How LDs organize the lipid supply to different cellular fates is just starting to be elucidated. Formation of membrane contact sites (MCSs; defined as regions where the two membranes of similar or different organelles are <30 nm from each other) between LDs and target organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria, is emerging as an important mechanism regulating lipid transfer (1, 2). MCSs can ensure timely and local lipid supply, avoiding lipotoxicity and missorting of valuable energetic and metabolic substrates. In support of the biological relevance of these mechanisms, up to 26 different Rab GTPases reside on LDs, representing 20% of the LD proteome (3). Interestingly, a subpopulation of these proteins [e.g., Rab5 (a, b, and c), Rab8 (a and b), Rab11 (a), Rab13, Rab14, Rab15, and Rab21] is also associated with the early endosomal system. Early endosomes (EEs) are the major endocytic compartments mediating sorting of proteins, lipids, and lipoproteins. Early biochemical studies proposed the existence of physical interactions between LDs and EEs (4). The existence of these contacts in mammalian cells has not been further explored. The figure illustrates that EE tubules, defined by the presence of internalized transferrin, interact with LDs in mammalian cells. BHK cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding human transferrin receptor (TfR plus plasmid encoding GFP) and then incubated with transferrin-HRP for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then processed for HRP detection and processed for electron microscopy using a mild fixation/low membrane-contrast staining method to optimize transferrin-HRP visualization. Transferrin-HRP-labeled EE tubules (arrows) were specifically associated with LDs (asterisks) as shown in the low magnification overview (left panel) and at higher magnification in the lower right panel. The two pseudocolored panels show higher magnification views of the neighboring panels, with ER in blue and the LD monolayer in orange; note the tripartite interaction with the EE tubule (EE, arrows). The images clearly demonstrate that LDs can form a distinct MCS with tubules of the EE but also that LD-EE contacts can interact in tripartite fashion with the ER. While hitherto elusive in mammalian cells, the existence and function of three-way contacts between lysosomes, LDs, and ER have been well described in yeast (2). With EEs acting as central hubs in lipid trafficking, these observations provide a new perspective on the complexity of LD interactions in mammalian cells.",10.1194/jlr.ILR120000876,2020-11-01,https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/RGPEM2020-Q1895,Research Data Manager (RDM) at The University of Queensland: RGPEM2020-Q1895

We demonstrate that mammalian LDs are endowed with a protein-mediated antimicrobial capacity, which is up-regulated by danger signals. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), multiple host defense proteins, including interferon-inducible guanosine triphosphatases and the antimicrobial cathelicidin, assemble into complex clusters on LDs. LPS additionally promotes the physical and functional uncoupling of LDs from mitochondria, reducing fatty acid metabolism while increasing LD-bacterial contacts. Thus, LDs actively participate in mammalian innate immunity at two levels: They are both cell-autonomous organelles that organize and use immune proteins to kill intracellular pathogens as well as central players in the local and systemic metabolic adaptation to infection.",10.1126/science.aay8085,2020-10-15,https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/RGPEM2020-Q1895,Research Data Manager (RDM) at The University of Queensland: RGPEM2020-Q1895

Any other rows (e.g. ""Thickness"", ""AnalysisUnitName"", ""Sample Name"", and rows referring to ages of samples should be removed prior to running the R scripts. You can also find the R codes to retrieve disturbances from these datasets (*dataset*_mean_sd), diversity calculations (adapted from Dr. Daniele Colombaroli's diversity scripts, *dataset*_formatting_div) and the R script for the statistical modelling of the hypoteses to be tested in the paper (RecoveryR_Richness_Statistics_Script_12Nov19). Additionally, the data for the statistical analyses can be found in the .csv filest ""RecoveryRates_BiolLetters_rich.csv"" (for the first hypothesis) and ""RecoveryRates_BiolLetters_vsi.csv"" (for the second hypothesis).Funding",10.5061/dryad.xwdbrv19c,2020-03-30,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xwdbrv19c,Dryad

Moreover, much is unknown regarding the nature, spread and persistence of DNA shed by animals into terrestrial environments, or the optimal experimental design for understanding these potential biases. To address some of these challenges, we compared the detection of terrestrial mammals using eDNA analysis of soil samples against confirmed species observations from a long-term (~9-yr) camera trapping study. At the same time, we considered multiple experimental parameters, including two sampling designs, two DNA extraction kits and two metabarcodes of different sizes. All mammals regularly recorded with cameras were detected in eDNA. In addition, eDNA reported many unrecorded small mammals whose presence in the study area is otherwise documented. A long metabarcode (≈220bp) offering a high taxonomic resolution, achieved a similar efficiency as a shorter one (≈70bp) and a phosphate buffer-based extraction gave similar results as a total DNA extraction method, for a fraction of the price. Our results support that eDNA-based monitoring should become a valuable part of ecosystem surveys, yet mitochondrial reference databases need to be enriched first.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2547d7wmf,2019-12-09,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2547d7wmf,Dryad

Although constriction comprises up to half of the cell cycle, its impact on cell size control and homeostasis has rarely been considered. To reveal the roles of cell elongation and constriction in bacterial size regulation during cell division, we captured the shape dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus with time-lapse structured illumination microscopy and used molecular markers as cell-cycle landmarks. We perturbed the constriction rate using a hyperconstriction mutant or fosfomycin ([(2R,3S)-3-methyloxiran-2-yl]phosphonic acid) inhibition. We report that the constriction rate contributes to both size control and homeostasis, by determining elongation during constriction and by compensating for variation in pre-constriction elongation on a single-cell basis.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2018.05.020,2018-06-01,10.5281/zenodo.1248441 and 10.5281/zenodo.1241005,Zenodo

The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) is especially important, because it is more frequently preserved and somewhat decoupled from dietary function.

This study is the largest investigation of EDJ morphology in modern humans to date, spanning 161 archaeological individuals from six continents. These data demonstrate that the EDJ evolves neutrally, and biomedical imaging of EDJ morphology can therefore be used as a non-invasive method to investigate ancient population movement and human genetic structure.",https://github.com/teslamonson/EDJ,2020-10-06,https://github.com/teslamonson/EDJ,github

The IMB buoy provides data between 2013-07-31T17:28:00 and 2013-10-11T00:30:00.The IMB buoy was kindly provided by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS). The IMB buoy consisted of a thermistor string of 5 m length, with a 2 cm sensor spacing. Interfaces were determined by hand. Heating cycle data was of poor quality, so the interfaces were picked mostly based on temperature. The ice interface will be pretty good (~2 cm accuracy), and the snow is probably a bit more inaccurate. The bottom interface was determined from the existence of a knee in the temperature profile where apparent. The top interface was picked based on the transition to constant temperature in the air and the diurnal variability. This may be subject to some bias, but note that the changes are only a few cm until the end where the IMB probably died because it got washed over (based on recorded temperatures). No flooding is apparent in the measurements.",10.1594/PANGAEA.933424,2021-08-01,https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.933424,Pangaea.de

Methanesulfonic acid is detected in the mass spectrometer either as a deprotonated ion or as a cluster with the reagent ion (NO3-). The concentration is calculated as the area of these two peaks normalized to the concentration of the reagent ions (monomer, dimer and trimer) and multiplied by a calibration factor that was experimentally derived at Paul Scherrer Institute in the summer 2017, after the campaign.In the atmosphere, methanesulfonic acid is produced by the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide that is mostly emitted in the atmosphere by phytoplankton. Methanesulfonic acid can contribute to the growth of aerosol particles by condensation or aqueous phase processing in clouds. The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from 22 January 2017 to 19 March 2017. There are no data for the first leg of the expedition because the instrument was not on the ship.

While the genome-wide distribution of this mark has been studied to great detail, the mechanisms responsible for its correct deposition, as well as the cause for its aberrant localization in cancers, have not been fully elucidated. Here we have compared the activity of individual DNMT3A isoforms in mouse embryonic stem and neuronal progenitor cells and report that these isoforms differ in their genomic binding and DNA methylation activity at regulatory sites. We identify that the longer isoform DNMT3A1 preferentially localizes to the methylated shores of bivalent CpG island promoters in a tissue-specific manner. The isoform-specific targeting of DNMT3A1 coincides with elevated hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) deposition, suggesting an involvement of this isoform in mediating turnover of DNA methylation at these sites. Through genetic deletion and rescue experiments, we demonstrate that this isoform-specific recruitment plays a role in maintenance of DNA methylation at CpG island shores, with implications on H3K27me3 deposition and regulation of developmental genes.",GSE96529,2017-10-27,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96529,Gene Expression Omnibus

Particles in this size range are important for cloud formation because a sub-set of them can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).The time series of the size distribution shows that the particle population over the Southern Ocean can be quite variable featuring three dominant modes: a new particle formation mode (11 - 30 nm); an Aitken mode (20 - 70 nm); and an accumulation mode (> 70 nm). Often a concentration minimum between the Aitken and accumulation mode can be observed. It is known as Hoppel minimum (Hoppel and Frick, 1990; 10.1016/0960-1686(90)90020-N). Typically, particles larger than this minimum act as CCN. The variability of the particle size spectrum is a result of particle sources and atmospheric processes. Sea spray generation adds larger particles likely with a peak in the mode around 200 nm. Trace gas emissions from microbial communities in the ocean, such as dimethylsulfide (DMS) will be oxidized to either sulphuric acid or methanesulfonic acid in the atmosphere which condense onto pre-existing particles, hence growing those. Sulphuric acid can also form new particles (new particle formation mode). Rain and snow will remove particles larger than the Hoppel minimum.The data set can be used to explore the variability of the particle size distribution in three different oceans around Antarctica (Indian, Pacific, Atlantic Oceans) and from Cape Town to Europe in relation to weather patterns, air mass trajectories, microbial activity etc. It is best used in combination with CCN data to explore the importance of particles for cloud formation. This data set cannot be used to unambiguously determine sources of particles over the southern ocean or to trace anthropogenic impact in the region.The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel.We give five-minute average data as dN/dlog(dp), where dN is the particle number concentration per measured size bin normalized over the logarithm of the bin width. The bin width is defined as the distance between two diameters. They are spaced equally in log-space with dlog(dp) = log(d_n+1/d_n) = 1/64. To derive the total particle number concentration between 11 and 400 nm one has to integrate over the diameter range taking into account the normalization by dlog(dp).Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017.

179089,E44A3884-C0DD-404E-A6D3-17FEF512A136,Leaf litter diversity and structure of microbial decomposer communities modulate litter decomposition in aquatic systems,"1. Leaf litter decomposition is a major ecosystem process that can link aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems by flows of nutrients. Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research hypothesizes that the global loss of species leads to impaired decomposition rates and thus to slower recycling of nutrients. Especially in aquatic systems an understanding of diversity effects on litter decomposition is still incomplete. 2. Here we conducted an experiment to test two main factors associated with global species loss that might influence leaf litter decomposition. Firstly, we tested whether mixing different leaf species alters litter decomposition rates compared to decomposition of these species in monoculture. Secondly, we tested the effect of the size structure of a lotic decomposer community on decomposition rates. 3. Overall, leaf litter identity strongly affected decomposition rates, and the observed decomposition rates matched measures of metabolic activity and microbial abundances. While we found some evidence of a positive leaf litter diversity effect on decomposition, this effect was not coherent across all litter combinations and the effect was generally additive and not synergistic. 4. Microbial communities, with a reduced functional and trophic complexity, showed a small but significant overall reduction in decomposition rates compared to communities with the naturally complete functional and trophic complexity, highlighting the importance of a complete microbial community on ecosystem functioning. 5. Our results suggest that top-down diversity effects of the decomposer community on litter decomposition in aquatic systems are of comparable importance as bottom-up diversity effects of primary producers.",10.5061/dryad.83mr1,2018-08-24,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.83mr1,Dryad

Here we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem function depend on intraspecific competition, a fine-scale process, by manipulating intraspecific density of shredding macroinvertebrates and examining effects on leaf litter decomposition, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. For two species, we found that per capita leaf processing rates declined with increasing density following power functions with negative exponents, likely due to interference competition. To demonstrate consequences of this nonlinearity, we scaled up estimates of leaf litter processing fromshredder abundance surveys in 10 replicated headwater streams. In accordance with Jensen’s inequality, applying densitydependent consumption rates reduced estimates of catchment-scale leafconsumption by an order of magnitude relative to density-independent rates. Density-dependent consumption estimates aligned closely with metabolic requirements in catchments with large -but not small- shredder populations. Importantly, shredder abundance was not limited by leaf litter availability, and catchment-level leaf litter supply was much higher than estimated consumption. Thus leaf litter processing was notlimited by resource supply. Our work highlights the need for scaling up, which accounts for intraspecific interactions.",0000-0002-4831-6958,2020-03-01,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.3124p62,Dryad

Thus, an understanding of what microorganisms are released and how they change microbial communities within natural streams is needed. To characterize the community shifts in streams receiving WWTP effluent, we sampled water-column microorganisms from upstream, downstream, and the effluent of WWTPs located on 23 headwater streams in which no other effluent was released upstream. We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We hypothesized that the downstream community profile would be a hydraulic mixture between the two sources (i.e., upstream and effluent). In ordination analyses, the downstream bacterial community profile was a mixture between the upstream and effluent. For 14 of the sites, the main contribution (>50%) to the downstream community originated from bacteria in the WWTP effluent and significant shifts in relative abundance of specific sequence variants were detected. These shifts in sequence variants may serve as general bioindicators of wastewater-effluent influenced streams, with a human-gut related Ruminococcus genus displaying the highest shift (30-fold higher abundances downstream). However, not all taxa composition changes were predicted based on hydraulic mixing alone. Specifically, the decrease of Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast reads was not adequately described by hydraulic mixing. The potential alteration of stream microbial communities via a high inflow of human-gut related bacteria and a decrease in autotrophic functional groups resulting from WWTP effluent creates the potential for general shifts in stream ecosystem function.",0000-0002-4831-6958,2020-03-01,https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4540304.v1,Dryad

Most important are terrestrial leaf litter subsidies, which differ depending on land use. We lack a good understanding of the variation of these inputs across spatial scales. Objectives: We sought to determine: (1) the relative importance of local versus catchment-level forestation for benthic leaf litter biomass in streams, (2) how landscape configuration alters these relationships, and (3) how land use affects the quality and diversity of leaf litter subsidies. Methods: We measured biomass and identity of benthic leaf litter in 121 reaches in 10 independent catchments seasonally over the course of a year. We assessed direct and indirect effects of forestation, reach position, and seasonality on leaf litter biomass using structural equation models, and assessed how leaf litter diversity varied with land use. Results: In catchments with forested headwaters, the degree of forestation and reach position in the catchment influenced benthic leaf litter biomass indirectly through local reach-scale forestation. In catchments where forest was only located downstream, or with minimal forest, none of these factors influenced reach-level benthic leaf litter. Leaf litter diversity peaked in fall in all land use types, but was generally lowest in forested reaches. Conclusions: Not only habitat amount, but its location relative to other habitats is important for ecosystem function in the context of cross-ecosystem material flows. Here, lack of upstream forest altered spatial patterns of leaf litter storage. Studies with high spatiotemporal resolution may further reveal effects of landscape configuration on other ecosystems.",10.5061/dryad.j675k0j,2019-07-10,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.j675k0j,Dryad
179089,0EFB4AAA-2717-4C63-BFB6-2A0B3DC254A9,Subsidies mediate interactions between communities across space,"Most spatial ecology focuses on how species dispersal affects community dynamics and coexistence. Ecosystems, however, are also commonly connected by flows of resources. We experimentally tested how neighbouring communities indirectly influence each other in absence of dispersal, via resource exchanges. Using two-patch microcosm meta-ecosystems, we manipulated community composition and dynamics, by varying separately species key functional traits (autotroph versus heterotroph species and size of consumer species) and trophic structure of aquatic communities (species growing alone, or in presence of competitors or predators). We then analysed the effects of species functional traits and trophic structure on communities connected through spatial subsidies in the absence of actual dispersal. Both functional traits and trophic structure strongly affected dynamics across neighbouring communities. Heterotroph communities connected to autotroph neighbours developed better than with heterotroph neighbours, such that coexistence of competitors was determined by the functional traits of the neighbouring community. Densities in autotroph communities were also strikingly higher when receiving subsidies from heterotroph communities compared to their own subsidies when grown in isolated ecosystems. In contrast, communities connected to predator-dominated ecosystems collapsed, without any direct contact with the predators. Our results demonstrate that because community composition and structure modify the distribution of biomass within a community, they may also affect communities connected through subsidies through quantitative and qualitative changes of detritus flows. This stresses that ecosystem management should account for such interdependencies mediated by spatial subsidies, given that local community alterations cascade across space onto other ecosystems even if species dispersal is completely absent.",10.5061/dryad.93hd6,2016-11-21,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.93hd6,Dryad

Studies of species spread in heterogeneous landscapes have traditionally characterized invasion velocities as functions of the mean resource density throughout the landscape, thus neglecting higher-order moments of the spatial resource distribution. Here, we show theoretically that different spatial arrangements of resources lead to different spread velocities even if the mean resource density throughout the landscape is kept constant. Specifically, we find that increasing the resource autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the speed of species spread. The model shows that demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is strengthened when individuals can actively move towards resources. We then experimentally corroborated the theoretically predicted reduction in propagation speed in microcosm experiments with the protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in landscapes with different resource autocorrelation lengths. Our work identifies the resource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of landscape susceptibility to biological invasions, which needs to be considered for predicting invasion dynamics within naturally heterogeneous environmental corridors.",10.5061/dryad.51mq6,2017-04-05,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.51mq6,Dryad

While the evolutionary effects of various stressors have been broadly studied, it is only more recently that the relevance of interactions between evolution and underlying ecological conditions, that is, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, have been highlighted. Here, we experimentally investigated how populations adapt to pH-stress under high population densities. Using the protist species Tetrahymena thermophila, we studied how four different genotypes evolved in response to stressfully low pH conditions and high population densities. We found that genotypes underwent evolutionary changes, some shifting up and others shifting down their intrinsic rates of increase (r0). Overall, evolution at low pH led to the convergence of r0 and intraspecific competitive ability (α) across the four genotypes. Given the strongcorrelation between r0 and α, we argue that this convergence was a consequence of selection for increased density-dependent fitness at low pH under the experienced high density conditions. Increased density-dependent fitness was either attained throughincrease in r0, or decrease of α, depending on the genetic background. In conclusion, we show that demography can influence the direction of evolution under abiotic stress.",0000-0002-5164-0978,2019-12-10,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.mpg4f4qvg,Dryad
179089,88E2A6BC-B5DE-4CC6-9F7B-404AFD5CB16E,"Intransitive competition is common across five major taxonomic groups and is driven by productivity, competitive rank and functional traits","1. Competition can be fully hierarchical or intransitive, and this degree of hierarchy is driven by multiple factors, including environmental conditions, the functional traits of the species involved or the topology of competition networks. Studies simultaneously analyzing these drivers of competition hierarchy are rare. Additionally, organisms compete either directly or via interference competition for resources or space, within a local neighbourhood or across the habitat. Therefore, the drivers of competition could change accordingly and depend on the taxa studied. 2. We performed the first multi-taxon study on pairwise competition across major taxonomic groups, including experiments with vascular plants, mosses, saprobic fungi, aquatic protists and soil bacteria. We evaluated how general is competition intransitivity from the pairwise competition matrix including all species and also for each possible three-species combination (triplets). We then examined which species were likely to engage in competitive loops and the effects of environmental conditions, competitive rank, and functional traits on intransitive competition. 3. We found some degree of competition intransitivity in all taxa studied, with 38% to 5% of triplets being intransitive. Variance in competitive rank between species and more fertile conditions strongly reduced intransitivity, with triplets composed of species differing widely in their competitive ranks much less likely to be intransitive. 4. Including functional traits of the species involved more than doubled the variation explained compared to models including competitive rank only. Both trait means and variance within triplets affected the odds of them being intransitive. However the traits responsible and the direction of trait effects varied widely between taxa, suggesting that traits can have a wide variety of effects on competition. 5. Synthesis: We evaluated the drivers of competition across multiple taxa and showed that productivity and competitive rank are fundamental drivers of intransitivity. We also showed that not only the functional traits of each species, but also those of the accompanying species, determine competition intransitivity. Intransitive competition is common across multiple taxa but can dampen under fertile conditions or for those species with large variance in their competitive abilities. This provides a first step towards predicting the prevalence of intransitive competition in natural communities.",10.5061/dryad.bh41r,2019-01-17,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bh41r,Dryad

However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e., local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.",10.5061/dryad.pm4n81q,2018-11-26,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pm4n81q,Dryad
179089,F31A7D8B-81B8-4F23-97AB-AC7ABD7F9B34,Species turnover and invasion of dominant freshwater invertebrates alter biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship,"Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, non-native amphipod species generally had lower biomass-adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and non-native species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by non-native heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with non-native arrivals. Experiments which neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.",10.5061/dryad.78g8h50,2018-02-08,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.78g8h50,Dryad

179089,85B40DB2-DBFF-44EB-9BF7-B0BFC7F82A2D,"Evolution in interacting species alters predator life-history traits, behaviour and morphology in experimental microbial communities","Predator-prey interactions heavily influence the dynamics of many ecosystems. An increasing body of evidence suggests that rapid evolution and coevolution can alter these interactions, with important ecological implications, by acting on traits determining fitness, including reproduction, anti-predatory defence and foraging efficiency. However, most studies to date have focused only on evolution in the prey species, and the predator traits in (co)evolving systems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated changes in predator traits after approximately 600 generations in a predator-prey (ciliate-bacteria) evolutionary experiment. Predators independently evolved on seven different prey species, allowing generalization of the predator's evolutionary response. We used highly resolved automated image analysis to quantify changes in predator life history, morphology and behaviour. Consistent with previous studies, we found that prey evolution impaired growth of the predator, although the effect depended on the prey species. By contrast, predator evolution did not cause a clear increase in predator growth when feeding on ancestral prey. However, predator evolution affected morphology and behaviour, increasing size, speed and directionality of movement, which have all been linked to higher prey search efficiency. These results show that in (co)evolving systems, predator adaptation can occur in traits relevant to foraging efficiency without translating into an increased ability of the predator to grow on the ancestral prey type.",0000-0002-4831-6958,2020-06-10,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.08kprr4zr,Dryad

While the evolutionary effects of various stressors have been broadly studied, it is only more recently that the relevance of interactions between evolution and underlying ecological conditions, that is, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, have been highlighted. Here, we experimentally investigated how populations adapt to pH-stress under high population densities. Using the protist species Tetrahymena thermophila, we studied how four different genotypes evolved in response to stressfully low pH conditions and high population densities. We found that genotypes underwent evolutionary changes, some shifting up and others shifting down their intrinsic rates of increase (r0). Overall, evolution at low pH led to the convergence of r0 and intraspecific competitive ability (α) across the four genotypes. Given the strong correlation between r0 and α, we argue that this convergence was a consequence of selection for increased density-dependent fitness at low pH under the experienced high density conditions. Increased density-dependent fitness was either attained through increase in r0 , or decrease of α, depending on the genetic background. In conclusion, we show that demography can influence the direction of evolution under abiotic stress.",10.5061/dryad.mpg4f4qvg,2019-12-17,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.mpg4f4qvg,Dryad

Ozone (O3) mixing ratios were measured with a 2B Technology ozone monitor, model 205. We report five-minute averaged data cleaned from exhaust gas influence. Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017.The trace gas concentrations represent a large number of atmospheric processes that happen on different time scales. CO for example, has basically no sources other than combustion and can hence be used as tracer for air mass transport from regions with combustion activities (e.g., South Africa). CO has a lifetime of a few weeks. CO2 and CH4 are longer-lived trace gases which disperse globally. The data set shows that concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere are higher than in the Southern Hemisphere. Both trace gases are emitted by anthropogenic activities as well as natural sources. Over the cruise track, areas of the Southern Ocean were passed where these trace gases either outgas or are absorbed. Ozone is a secondary trace gas, meaning that it is formed in the atmosphere. It’s concentrations are relatively low.All trace gases data have been cleaned from exhaust gas influence.",10.5281/zenodo.2636779,2019-06-19,https://zenodo.org/record/2636779#.XvWZH9XKFhE,Zenodo

166594,136B4DA4-C31D-4B92-B869-BD6293E3F71C,Bayesian Correlation is a robust similarity measure for single cell RNA-seq data,"Single-cell analysis of the transcriptome deepens our understanding of an individual cell's contribution to its microenvironment. Using single-cell analysis to study complex biological processes requires state-of-the-art computational tools. Assessing similarity is highly important for bioinformatics algorithms in order to determine correlations between biological information. Similarity can appear by chance, particularly for low expressed entities. This is especially relevant in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) because the read counts obtained are lower compared to bulk RNA-sequencing and therefore classic bioinformatics tools are insufficient to obtain reproducible results. Recently, a Bayesian correlation scheme, that assigns low correlation values to correlations coming from low expressed genes, has been proposed to assess similarity for bulk RNA-seq and miRNA. This Bayesian method uses a prior distribution before using empirical evidence. Our goal was to extend the properties of this Bayesian correlation scheme to scRNA-seq data. We assessed 3 ways to compute similarity. First, we computed the similarity of each pair of genes over all cells. Second, we identified specific cell populations and computed the correlation in those specific cells. Third, we computed the similarity of each pair of genes over all clusters, by including the total mRNA expression in those cells. To study the effect of the number of cells on the method, we did not rely on simulated data, we generated 4 scRNA-seq mouse liver cell libraries with a varying number of input cells. Results: We show that Bayesian correlations are more reproducible than Pearson correlations in all the scenarios studied. Compared to Pearson correlations, Bayesian correlations have a smaller dependence on the number of input cells. We demonstrate that the Bayesian correlation algorithm assigns high similarity values to genes with a biological relevance in a specific population. Significance: Our results demonstrate that Bayesian correlation is a robust similarity measure for scRNA-seq datasets. The Bayesian method allows researchers to study similarity between pairs of genes without discarding low expressed entities and to minimize biasing the results by fake correlations. Taken together, using our method of Bayesian correlation the reproducibility of scRNA-seq experiments is increased significantly.",GSE134134,2019-12-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134134,GEO

However, their properties were barely harnessed in multimetalic structures because of the lack of both monitoring methods and accessible synthetic pathways. We herein report a remedy to monitor and control the formation of CrIII-containing assemblies in solution via the design of a CrIIIN6 inert “complex-as-ligand” that can be included into polymetalic architectures. As a proof of concept, these CrN6 building blocks were reacted in solution with ZnII or FeII to give extended trinuclear linear Cr-M-Cr assemblies, the structure of which could be addressed by NMR spectroscopy despite the presence of two slow relaxing CrIII paramagnetic centers. In addition to long CrIII excited state lifetimes and weak sensitivity to oxygen quenching, these polymetallic assemblies display controlled CrIIIto MII energy transfers, which pave the way for use of the “complex-as-ligand” strategy for introducing photophysically active CrIII probes into light-converting polymetalic devices.",DOI:10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b03163,2020-03-24,https://zenodo.org/record/3632899#.XnoeqIhKg2x,Zenodo

The wrapped arrangement of the six-membered dqp chelating ligands around the Cr(III)provided nonplanar helical conformations leading to the diastereoselective assembly of chiral bistridentatemonometallic Cr(III)-helix. The PP-(+)-[Cr(dqp)2]3+ and MM-(−)-[Cr(dqp)2]3+enantiomers could be separated and isolated by using cation-exchange chromatography andsubsequent salt-metathesis with KPF6. X-ray crystallographic analysis based on Flack parametersassigned the absolute configurations of the two enantiomers. Circularly polarized luminescence(CPL) spectra showed two polarized emission bands within the NIR region corresponding to thecharacteristic metal-centered spin-flip Cr(2E → 4A2) and Cr(2T1 → 4A2) transitions withexceptionally high dissymmetry factors, |glum|, of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, which are comparable tothose reported for rare-earth chiral complexes.

We observe that at subduction margins around the globe, the edge of continental shelves tends to be located above the downdip end of seismic coupling on the megathrust. Coastlines lie farther landward at variable distances. This observation stems from a compilation of well-resolved coseismic and interseismic coupling datasets. The permanent interseismic uplift component of the total tectonic deformation can explain the localization of the shelf break. It contributes a short wave-length gradient in vertical deformation on top of the structural and isostatic deformation of the margin. This places a hinge line between seaward subsidence and landward uplift above the downdip end of high coupling. Landward of the hinge line, rocks are uplifted in the domain of wave-base erosion and a shelf is maintained by the competition of rock uplift and wave erosion. wave erosion then sets the coastline back from the tectonically meaningful shelf break.We combine a wave erosion model with an elastic deformation model to illustrate how the downdip end of high coupling pins the location of the shelf break. In areas where the shelf is wide, onshore geodetic constraints on seismic coupling is limited and could be advantageously complemented by considering the location of the shelf break. Subduction margin morphology integrates hundreds of seismic cycles and could inform seismic coupling stability through time.",doi: 10.5880/GFZ.4.7.2020.002,2020-12-22,https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/panmetaworks/review/76cc34fa37275fae183f94743316315b64049915d4c393f44106b203f7cb9e20/,GFZ DataServices

Through genome-wide analysis of de novo methylation activity in murine stem cells we uncover that DNMT3A prefers to methylate CpGs followed by cytosines or thymines, while DNMT3B predominantly methylates CpGs followed by guanines or adenines. These signatures are further observed at non-CpG sites, resembling methylation context observed in specialised cell types, including neurons and oocytes. We further show that these preferences result from structural differences in the catalytic domains of the two de novo DNMTs and are not a consequence of differential recruitment to the genome. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that, in case of human DNMT3A, the preference is due to favourable polar interactions between the flexible Arg836 side chain and the guanine that base-pairs with the cytosine following the CpG. By exchanging arginine to a lysine, the corresponding side chain in DNMT3B, the sequence preference is reversed, confirming the requirement for arginine at this position. This context-dependent enzymatic activity provides additional insights into the complex regulation of DNA methylation patterns.",10.1093/nar/gkaa1168,2020-11-16,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151992,Gene Expression Omnibus

They change direction by reversing their flagellar rotation, which switches the handedness of the filament's supercoil. So far, all studied functional filaments are composed of a mixture of L- and R-state flagellin monomers. Here we show in a study of the wild type Firmicute Kurthia sp., that curved, functional filaments can adopt a conformation in vivo that is closely related to a uniform, all-L-state. This sheds additional light on transitions of the flagellar supercoil and uniquely reveals the atomic structure of a wild-type flagellar filament in vivo, including six residues showing clearly densities of O-linked glycosylation.",10.2210/pdb6T17/pdb,2019-10-30,http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6T17,6T17.pdb

165800,92AC3D16-04A9-4754-909F-7F9C09B7A7AA,The effects of temperature and dispersal on species diversity in natural microbial metacommunities,"Dispersal is key for maintaining biodiversity at local- and regional scales in metacommunities. However, little is known about the combined effects of dispersal and climate change on biodiversity. Theory predicts that alpha-diversity is maximized at intermediate dispersal rates, resulting in a hump-shaped diversity-dispersal relationship. This relationship is predicted to flatten when competition increases. We anticipate that this same flattening will occur with increased temperature because, in the rising part of the temperature performance curve, interspecific competition is predicted to increase. We explored this question using aquatic communities of Sarracenia purpurea from early- and late-successional stages, in which we simulated four levels of dispersal and four temperature scenarios. With increased dispersal, the hump shape was observed consistently in late successional communities, but only in higher temperature treatments in early succession. Increased temperature did not flatten the hump-shape relationship, but decreased the level of alpha- and gamma-diversity. Interestingly, higher temperatures negatively impacted small-bodied species. These metacommunity-level extinctions likely relaxed interspecific competition, which could explain the absence of flattening of the diversity-dispersal relationship. Our findings suggest that climate change will cause extinctions both at local- and global- scales and emphasize the importance of intermediate levels of dispersal as an insurance for local diversity.",10.5061/dryad.xpnvx0kbf,2020-01-06,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.xpnvx0kbf,Dryad

Yet, little is known about how increased temperature will impact the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship. We tackled this subject theoretically and experimentally. We developed a BEF theory based on mechanistic population dynamic models, which allows the inclusion of the effect of temperature. Using experimentally established relationships between attack rate and temperature, the model predicts that temperature increase will intensify competition and consequently the BEF relationship will flatten or even become negative. We conducted a laboratory experiment with natural microbial microcosms and the results were in agreement with the model predictions. The experimental results also revealed that an increase of both temperature average and variation had a more intense effect than an increase of temperature average alone. Our results indicate that, under climate change, high diversity may not guarantee high ecosystem functioning.",10.5061/dryad.hk1h26n,2018-10-03,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.hk1h26n,Dryad

The IMB buoy consisted of a thermistor string of 5 m length, with a 2 cm sensor spacing. Interfaces were determined by hand. The bottom interface was determined from the existence of a knee in the temperature profile where apparent, combined with the heating cycle data. Both the amount of heating, and the ratio of heating at 60s over heating at 30s were used. This is very accurate up until ~day 300, and it is probably about +/- 4 cm after that. The snow interface was determined by the above, and looking at the knee in the temperature profile for each of the four temperature profiles during the day. This is more difficult to pick out, so accuracy here is maybe a few cm. Note flooding occurred at ~day 290 (probably up to freeboard level on ~day 278). The flooding interface was determined from day 250 on, and based mostly on the heating cycle. Clear surface snow melt on ~day 330, and IMB goes isothermal and warm on ~day 350.

Using full-locus constructs, we characterized the expression, biochemical properties, and possible modes of action of AGO3. Although AGO3 arose from a recent duplication at the AGO2 locus, their expression differs drastically, with AGO3 prevailing in aerial vascular terminations and specifically in chalazal seed integuments; accordingly, AGO3 down-regulation alters gene expression in siliques. Similar to AGO2, AGO3 binds sRNAs with a strong 5’-adenosine bias, but unlike most Arabidopsis AGOs - AGO2 included - it binds efficiently both 24nt and 21nt sRNAs. AGO3 immuno precipitation experiments in siliques revealed that these sRNAs mostly associate to genes and intergenic regions and not to canonical AGO targets, such as transposable elements. AGO3 localizes to the cytoplasm and co-fractionates with polysomes to possibly mediate PTGS via translation inhibition.",GSE124098,2020-08-28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124098,GEO SRA database

The mating pathway in budding yeast offers simplified settings to understand this process. Pheromone secreted by the mating partner triggers the activity of a MAPK pathway, which results in the expression of hundreds of genes. Using a dynamic expression reporter, we quantified the kinetics of gene expression in single cells upon exogenous pheromone stimulation and in the physiological context of mating. In both conditions, we observed striking differences in the timing of induction of mating‐responsive promoters. Biochemical analyses and generation of synthetic promoter variants demonstrated how the interplay between transcription factor binding and nucleosomes contributes to determine the kinetics of transcription in a simplified cell‐fate decision system.",https://doi.org/10.17867/10000114,2018-03-29,https://idr.openmicroscopy.org,IDR

Die Arbeiten erfolgen in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Staatsarchiv des Kantons Aargau und sind auf vier Jahre angelegt. Mit Unterstützung des Zürcher Rechtsquellenprojekts der Schweizerischen Rechtsquellenstiftung streben wir eine digitale Edition an, welche die wesentlichen Vorteile aktueller technischer Möglichkeiten nutzt, die Dokumente adäquat auszeichnet, gezielt miteinander verknüpft und für neue Zugriffsmöglichkeiten aufbereitet. Das Rückgrat des Unternehmens bildet der verhältnismässig geschlossene Bestand der überlieferten mittelalterlichen und frühneuzeitlichen Einzelblattdokumente des Klosters (STAAG U.17, 1291-1789), der - erweitert um auswärtige Stücke aus dem einstigen Kloster - in seiner historischen Entwicklung und in seinen wandelbaren Ordnungen nachvollziehbar gemacht werden soll. Aufgrund von nachträglich auf den Urkunden aufgebrachten Dorsualnotizen und Signaturen sollen historische Archivordnungen rekonstruiert sowie die späteren Abschriften dieser Urkunden nachgewiesen und verlinkt werden. So kann die Edition zugleich die Umorganisation und Umdeutung dieses Bestandes erschliessen. Wir nutzen die besondere Beweglichkeit einer digitalen Edition, um der Forschung in neuartiger Weise Entwicklungen eines Bestandes und dahinterliegende Umbrüche in der Schrift- und Administrationskultur zugänglich zu machen. Zugleich soll das Projekt Möglichkeiten digitalen Edierens im fachlichen Austausch reflektieren und vorantreiben.Mit dem historisch herausragenden Dokumenten- und Kopialbuchbestand der habsburgischen Klosterstiftung und der späteren Berner Landvogtei stellt die Edition bislang weitgehend fehlende Arbeitsgrundlagen für aktuelle Forschungsrichtungen bereit. Die Königsfelder Dokumente sind von höchstem Interesse für die Kunst-, Kultur-, Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte (vom Klosteralltag über den Klosterhaushalt bis hin zu Hofhaltung und Armenfürsorge), für die historischen Gender Studies und die Ordens- und Reformationsgeschichte. Zugleich wird unsere Edition neuen Ansätzen der Schweizer Geschichte entgegenkommen. Denn sie macht Gemengelagen zwischen unterschiedlichen Herrschaften (Habsburg, Kloster als Territorialherr, eidgenössische Orte) ebenso wie lokale Dimensionen von Staatsbildung, Territorialisierung und Konfessionalisierung fassbar. Das Projekt wird an der Universität Zürich angesiedelt, zielt auf eine enge Verkopplung von Editionsarbeit mit wissenschaftlicher Forschung und Lehre und wird Studierende mit Editionstechniken und archivalischen Gegebenheiten vertraut machen. Ausserdem wird das Projekt in Kooperation mit dem Staatsarchiv Aargau, dem Museum Aargau sowie weiteren Institutionen einen Beitrag zur Geschichtsvermittlung und Kulturgüterpflege leisten.Das Projekt…- rekonstruiert und ediert einen historischen Dokumentenbestand und erschliesst weitere bislang kaum edierte Typen klösterlicher und herrschaftlicher Quellen- unterstützt neue, über das «Werden und Wachsen der Eidgenossenschaft» hinausblickende Zugänge zur Geschichte der Schweiz- leistet einen Beitrag zur Weiterentwicklung der offenen digitalen Edition- wendet sich mit akademischer Lehre und über Kooperationen direkt an Studierende und ein grösseres Publikum",doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5179360.,2021-10-26,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5179361,ZENODO

In the vertebrate host the parasites grow and multiply by schizogony in two different environments: within erythrocytes and within hepatocytes. Whereas erythrocytic parasites are well-studied in this respect, relatively little is known about the exo-erythrocytic stages.Methods In an attempt to fill this gap, genome wide RNA-seq analyses of various exo-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium berghei including sporozoites, samples from a time-course of liver stage development and detached cells were performed. These latter contain infectious merozoites and represent the final step in exo-erythrocytic development. Results The analysis represents the complete transcriptome of the entire life cycle of P. berghei parasites with temporal detailed analysis of the liver stage allowing comparison of gene expression across the progression of the life cycle. These RNA-seq data from different developmental stages were used to cluster genes with similar expression profiles, in order to infer their functions. A comparison with published data from other parasite stages confirmed stage-specific gene expression and revealed numerous genes that are expressed differentially in blood and exo-erythrocytic stages. One of the most exo-erythrocytic stage-specific genes was PBANKA_1003900, which has previously been annotated as a “gametocyte specific protein”. The promoter of this gene drove high GFP expression in exo-erythrocytic stages, confirming its expression profile seen by RNA-seq. Conclusions The comparative analysis of the genome wide mRNA expression profiles of erythrocytic and different exo-erythrocytic stages could be used to improve the understanding of gene regulation in Plasmodium parasites and can be used to model exo-erythrocytic stage metabolic networks toward the identification of differences in metabolic processes during schizogony in erythrocytes and hepatocytes.",10.1186/s12936-019-2968-7,2019-12-24,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB23770,European Nucleotide Archive

High quality datasets with accurate 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) reference poses are the foundation for benchmarking and improving existing methods. Traditionally, reference poses have been obtained via Structure-from-Motion (SfM). However, SfM itself relies on local features which are prone to fail when images were taken under different conditions, e.g., day/night changes. At the same time, manually annotating feature correspondences is not scalable and potentially inaccurate. In this work, we propose a semi-automated approach to generate reference poses based on feature matching between renderings of a 3D model and real images via learned features. Given an initial pose estimate, our approach iteratively refines the pose based on feature matches against a rendering of the model from the current pose estimate. We significantly improve the nighttime reference poses of the popular Aachen Day-Night dataset, showing that state-of-the-art visual localization methods perform better (up to 47%) than predicted by the original reference poses. We extend the dataset with new nighttime test images, provide uncertainty estimates for our new reference poses, and introduce a new evaluation criterion. We will make our reference poses and our framework publicly available upon publication.",https://www.visuallocalization.net/,2020-12-23,https://www.visuallocalization.net/,Long-term visual localization

161697,5943049C-9BC1-4263-9CB7-7FB316FF2A5E,Data from: Predation-mediated ecosystem services and disservices in agricultural landscapes,"Ecological intensification may reduce environmental externalities of agriculture by harnessing biodiversity to benefit regulating ecosystem services. However, to propose management options for the production of such services, there is a need to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of net effects between ecosystem services and disservices provided by wild organisms across taxonomic groups in relation to habitat and landscape management. We studied the contribution of predatory vertebrates and invertebrates (including both carnivores and seed herbivores) to regulating ecosystem services and disservices in 16 cereal fields in response to a local habitat contrast and a landscape complexity gradient. From May to November 2016 we provided weed (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and crop (predation reflects a disservice) seeds, as well as pest (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and beneficial (predation reflects a disservice) invertebrate prey to predators. Seed predation was dominated by vertebrates, while vertebrates and invertebrates contributed equally to predation of animal prey. Before harvest, predation steadily increased from very low levels in May to high levels in July independent of the resource type. After harvest, ecosystem services declined more rapidly than disservices. The presence of adjacent semi-natural grasslands promoted crop seed predation, but reduced pest prey predation. Predation on beneficial prey decreased with increasing proportions of semi-natural grassland in the landscape. Predatory vertebrates and invertebrates provide important ecosystem services due to the consumption of pests. However, beneficial invertebrates and crop seeds were often consumed to a similar or even higher extent than harmful invertebrates or weed seeds. Our results therefore raise concerns that management options aimed at enhancing service providers may simultaneously increase levels of disservices. By considering positive and negative effects simultaneously, this study addresses an important knowledge gap and highlights the importance of interactions between local management, landscape composition and service and disservice provision across taxa and over time. Considering trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices when evaluating the net effects of biodiversity conservation measures on ecosystem service provision is crucial.

165031,E9AC0972-8DD2-4F40-B9BB-4AEDB26DFBCB,Receding ice drove parallel expansions in Southern Ocean penguins,"Climate shifts are key drivers of ecosystem change. Despite the critical importance of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean for global climate, the extent of climate-driven ecological change in this region remains controversial. In particular, the biological effects of changing sea ice conditions are poorly understood. We hypothesize that rapid postglacial reductions in sea ice drove biological shifts across multiple widespread Southern Ocean species. We test for demographic shifts driven by climate events over recent millennia by analyzing population genomic datasets spanning 3 penguin genera ( Eudyptes , Pygoscelis , and Aptenodytes ). Demographic analyses for multiple species (macaroni/royal, eastern rockhopper, Adélie, gentoo, king, and emperor) currently inhabiting southern coastlines affected by heavy sea ice conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) yielded genetic signatures of near-simultaneous population expansions associated with postglacial warming. Populations of the ice-adapted emperor penguin are inferred to have expanded slightly earlier than those of species requiring ice-free terrain. These concerted high-latitude expansion events contrast with relatively stable or declining demographic histories inferred for 4 penguin species (northern rockhopper, western rockhopper, Fiordland crested, and Snares crested) that apparently persisted throughout the LGM in ice-free habitats. Limited genetic structure detected in all ice-affected species across the vast Southern Ocean may reflect both rapid postglacial colonization of subantarctic and Antarctic shores, in addition to recent genetic exchange among populations. Together, these analyses highlight dramatic, ecosystem-wide responses to past Southern Ocean climate change and suggest potential for further shifts as warming continues.",10.1073/pnas.1904048116,2019-12-26,https://www.pnas.org/content/116/52/26690,PNAS

The XBT probes are manufactured and distributed by T.S.K./Sippican Tsurumi-Seiki Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan (http://www.tsk-jp.com) and are of the type T-07, which is rated at a ship speed of up to 15 knots. These probes have a measuring time of 123 seconds and maximum measurement depth of about 789 m. Probes were launched from a handheld device from the stern of the ship either on the port or starboard side while the ship was moving. The deck unit recorded the temperature and the time since the probe was launched. This time was then converted to depth using the known fall rate of the probe in seawater and the coefficients provided by the manufacturer (WMO standards; Hanawa et al., 1995). The profiles were corrected for known surface biases (Kizu and Hanawa, 2002; Uehara et al., 2008). We provide the raw data, the data produced by using the coefficients provided by the manufacturer, and a corrected version in which we apply an empirical correction based on a comparison with CTD data (Henry et al., 2019), where XBT profiles were launched alongside the CTD deployment. The data has been quality controlled by comparing it to a number of CTD profiles. Data is provided at full vertical resolution and a 1-m averaged resolution. In addition, we provide derived variables such as surface mixed layer depth (temperature threshold) estimates. We are grateful to the crew of the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov and AARI for donating these probes to our project. Their use-by date had expired, however this was not seen as an issue. This data set provides insights into the hydrography of the Southern Ocean during one austral summer season and complements the CTD temperature profiles measured during ACE by filling in the gaps between CTD stations.",10.5281/zenodo.3836648,2020-10-20,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3836648,Zenodo

In the latter, the spectrum is truncated to only the fundamental frequency and the upper and lower sidebands. Our experiments are performed on deep water waves, which are better described by the higher-order NLSE, the Dysthe equation. We therefore extend our analysis to this system. However, our conclusions are general for NLSE systems. By means of experimentally obtained phase-space trajectories, we demonstrate that forcing and damping cause a separatrix crossing during the evolution. When the system is damped, it is pulled outside the separatrix, which in the real space corresponds to a phase-shift of the envelope and therefore doubles the period of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence cycle. When the system is forced by the wind, it is pulled inside the separatrix, lifting the phase-shift. Furthermore, we observe a growth and decay cycle for modulated plane waves that are conventionally considered stable. Finally, we give a theoretical demonstration that forcing the NLSE system can induce symmetry breaking during the evolution.",doi:10.1007/s11071-020-06043-1,2020-12-29,https://yareta.unige.ch/#/home/detail/8841c6e4-3e3a-4f42-b3bd-3369fd7942f8,Yareta

Most importantly, the database provides an index of liberalization and another one of de-liberalization, which serve as measures of the incisiveness of each and every policy change. The construction of these indices is based on Peter Hall’s (1993) seminal work on policy changes as well as Baumgartner’s (2013) work on status quo changes.While the database’s unit of analysis is the individual reform, these data can easily be aggregated to obtain the liberalization/de-liberalization indices for each country-year or each country-year-policy-field. The code (in Stata) necessary to perform these transformations is made available online.When using data from this database, please cite both the database and, where appropriate, the original source.

To validate our results from the HEK293T reporter cells, we here tested our approach at different endogenous genomic loci and in different cell types. We first targeted the human beta globin (HBB) locus in the K562 cell line, and analyzed correction- and editing frequencies using next generation sequencing (NGS). Next we targeted the Rosa26 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Here, RNPD system was always compared to Cas9 SNAP-tag fusion proteins with uncoupled donor oligos. To also directly compare the engineered RNPD system to the classical CRISPR-Cas9 system, we performed experiments where we used wild-type Cas9 with the uncoupled donor oligos as a control. We therefore targeted the fluorescent reporter locus as well as the endogenous loci HBB, empty spiracles homeobox 1 (EMX1), and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in HEK293T cells.

175055,E88022BF-31FF-492D-93BD-90DAABFE95FE,The ambiguous #Dress image illusion,"In 2015, an ambiguous picture of a Dress triggered popular and scientific interest as different people perceive it having widely different colours. To help understand this phenomenon, we performed two studies. First, few days after the Dress appeared on the Internet, we projected the Dress to 240 students on a large screen (Experiment 1). The distribution of different colour perceivers partially confirms previous reports with the majority reporting seeing the Dress in blue and black (B&B; 48%) or white and gold (W&G; 38%). The third group of blue and brown (B&Br; 7%) viewers also emerged, and is worth further consideration. In a second, laboratory study, 57 participants used a computerized colour picker to precisely match colours of small squares (a) and vertical strips (b) cut out of the Dress picture, and the original Dress picture (c) (Experiment 2). Results indicated that lightness and chroma values of matched colours changed from B&B to B&Br to W&G viewers in contextualized images (b, c) only. Irrespective of viewer type or context conditions, the hues of the matched colours were either blue-purple (light parts of the Dress) or orange-yellow (dark parts). Finally, colours matched by B&B viewers were the closest to the colours displayed on the ambiguous Dress picture as compared to other viewer types. Our research supports the notion that the Dress effect emerges from differences in perceived lightness and chroma, but not hue. This phenomenon only occurs when all aspects of the picture are integrated, highlighting the importance of contextual information within the ambiguous Dress image.",https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/15066/0/,2017-11-03,https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/15066/0/,FORSbase

175055,4F800C8D-F53D-4BA5-89A1-2B189ACDBAB4,Colour-emotion associations in individuals with and without congenital red-green colour-blindness,"For over 100 years, popular and scientific communities have suggested that colours have psychological and affective implications (Kaya & Epps, 2004; Major, 1895; Wexner, 1954). Yet, most claims remain unsubstantiated, including the assumption that the actual perception of colour is a key ingredient to any such supposed implication. Since 2015, we have been systematically studying and publishing results on colour-emotion associations for colour terms and colour patches using the same overall methodology, testing different populations. We could already show that emotion associations with colour terms are highly consistent across different cultures, but that consistencies are even higher when cultures share borders and languages (Jonauskaite, Abdel-Khalek, et al., 2019; Jonauskaite, Abu-Akel, et al., 2020; Jonauskaite, Wicker, et al., 2019). For a Swiss sample, we also found high consistencies for emotion associations with colour terms and colour patches (Jonauskaite, Parraga, et al., 2020). These results indicate that such associations are majorly driven by conceptual mechanism.To elaborate on this latter point, we manipulated perceptual colour experience by testing individuals with and without congenital red-green colour-blindness. The first group experiences colour perception deficiencies, but both groups’ conceptual knowledge is comparable. We asked congenital red-green colour-blind (n = 64) and non-colour-blind (n = 66) men to associate 12 colours with 20 emotion concepts, and rate the emotion intensities. About half of each group provided associations with colour terms, the remainder with colour patches. We found that colour-blind and non-colour-blind men associated similar emotions with colours, irrespective of whether colours were conveyed via terms (r = .82) or patches (r = .80). No differences occurred when we categorised emotions according to valence, arousal, and power. Of interest, the colour-emotion associations and the emotion intensities were not modulated by participants’ severity of colour-blindness (CBI). Hinting at some additional, although minor, role of actual colour perception, the consistencies in associations for words and patches were higher in non-colour-blind than colour-blind men.Together, these results suggest that colour-emotion associations in adults are driven more importantly by conceptual mechanisms than direct perceptual experience of colour. Therefore, intact colour vision is not essential for having shared colour-emotion associations. The current findings add to a growing body of literature that colour-emotion associations represent another psychological universal.",https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/17358/0/,2021-11-03,https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/17358/0/,FORSbase

184934,28B7A310-CE10-4FB4-97A2-C28FD89E9FE5,Speciation through chromosomal fusion and fission in Lepidoptera,"Changes in chromosome numbers may strongly affect reproductive barriers, because individuals heterozygous for distinct karyotypes are typically expected to be at least partially sterile or to show reduced recombination. Therefore, several classic speciation models are based on chromosomal changes. One import mechanism generating variation in chromosome numbers is fusion and fission of existing chromosomes, which is particularly likely in species with holocentric chromosomes, i.e. chromosomes that lack a single centromere. Holocentric chromosomes evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, including in Lepidoptera . Although changes in chromosome numbers are hypothesized to be an important driver of the spectacular diversification of Lepidoptera, comparative studies across the order are lacking. We performed the first comprehensive literature survey of karyotypes for Lepidoptera species since the 1970s and tested if, and how, chromosomal variation might affect speciation. Even though a meta-analysis of karyological differences between closely related taxa did not reveal an effect on the degree of reproductive isolation, phylogenetic diversification rate analyses across the 16 best-covered genera indicated a strong, positive association of rates of chromosome number evolution and speciation. These findings suggest a macroevolutionary impact of varying chromosome numbers in Lepidoptera and likely apply to other taxonomic groups, especially to those with holocentric chromosomes. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",10.5281/zenodo.3735954,2020-08-31,https://zenodo.org/record/3735954,Zenodo

Here, we report the chemical synthesis and testing of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 ( C. eth-2.0 ), a rewritten bacterial genome composed of the most fundamental functions of a bacterial cell. We rebuilt the essential genome of Caulobacter crescentus through the process of chemical synthesis rewriting and studied the genetic information content at the level of its essential genes. Within the 785,701-bp genome, we used sequence rewriting to reduce the number of encoded genetic features from 6,290 to 799. Overall, we introduced 133,313 base substitutions, resulting in the rewriting of 123,562 codons. We tested the biological functionality of the genome design in C. crescentus by transposon mutagenesis. Our analysis revealed that 432 essential genes of C. eth-2.0 , corresponding to 81.5% of the design, are equal in functionality to natural genes. These findings suggest that neither changing mRNA structure nor changing the codon context have significant influence on biological functionality of synthetic genomes.

Here, we report the chemical synthesis and testing of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 ( C. eth-2.0 ), a rewritten bacterial genome composed of the most fundamental functions of a bacterial cell. We rebuilt the essential genome of Caulobacter crescentus through the process of chemical synthesis rewriting and studied the genetic information content at the level of its essential genes. Within the 785,701-bp genome, we used sequence rewriting to reduce the number of encoded genetic features from 6,290 to 799. Overall, we introduced 133,313 base substitutions, resulting in the rewriting of 123,562 codons. We tested the biological functionality of the genome design in C. crescentus by transposon mutagenesis. Our analysis revealed that 432 essential genes of C. eth-2.0 , corresponding to 81.5% of the design, are equal in functionality to natural genes.

However, systematic testing of this is scarce. Here we examine this hypothesis in two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa, which co-occur at two calamine metalliferous (M) sites harbouring toxic levels of the heavy metals zinc and cadmium. We conduct individual genome resequencing alongside soil elemental analysis for 64 plants from eight populations on M and non-metalliferous (NM) soils, and identify genomic footprints of selection and local adaptation. Selective sweep and environmental association analyses indicate a modest degree of gene as well as functional network convergence, whereby the proximal molecular factors mediating this convergence mostly differ between site pairs and species. Notably, we observe repeated selection on identical single nucleotide polymorphisms in several A. halleri genes at two independently colonized M sites. Our data suggest that species-specific metal handling and other biological features could explain a low degree of convergence between species. The parallel establishment of plant populations on calamine M soils involves convergent evolution, which will probably be more pervasive across sites purposely chosen for maximal similarity in soil composition.",10.5061/dryad.jg30j4v,2019-06-10,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jg30j4v,Dryad

To investigate the underlying biology, we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of >1500 cells from six primary TNBC. Here, we show that intercellular heterogeneity of gene expression programs within each tumor is variable and largely correlates with clonality of inferred genomic copy number changes, suggesting that genotype drives the gene expression phenotype of individual subpopulations. Clustering of gene expression profiles identified distinct subgroups of malignant cells shared by multiple tumors, including a single subpopulation associated with multiple signatures of treatment resistance and metastasis, and characterized functionally by activation of glycosphingolipid metabolism and associated innate immunity pathways. A novel signature defining this subpopulation predicts long-term outcomes for TNBC patients in a large cohort.

Host cell entry and egress from infected cells are two key steps in the lytic cycle of this obligate intracellular parasite that ensures its survival and dissemination. Egress is a temporally orchestrated process underpinned by the regulated exocytosis of the apical secretory organelles, termed micronemes. At any point during intracellular replication, deleterious environmental changes resulting from a loss of host cell integrity can trigger egress via the activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). Remarkably, even in the absence of extrinsic alarming signals, the parasites naturally egress from infected cells in a coordinated manner after ca. 5 to 6 cycles of binary fission. Here we show that diacylglycerol kinase 2 (DGK2) is secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole where it produces phosphatidic (PA), which acts as intrinsic signal to elicit natural egress. PA activates a large guanylate cyclase (GC) receptor uniquely conserved in apicomplexans and composed of one P4-ATPase and two guanylate cyclase domains. Assembly of a functional GC at the parasite plasma membrane critically depends on the association with two proteins acting as cofactors.

Here, we show that inactive PKAc1 is maintained at the parasite pellicle by interacting with dually acylated PKAr. Either a conditional knockdown of PKAr or the overexpression of PKAc1 results in a block in parasite division. In contrast, conditional expression of a dominant negative PKAr isoform unable to bind cAMP, triggers premature egress of parasites from infected cells. This untimely egress critically depends on parasite density and host cell acidification. A comparative phosphoproteome analysis reveals that PKA genetic inhibition significantly changed the phosphorylation profile of a putative cGMP-phosphodiesterase, PDE2. Consistently, the phenotype of PKA genetic inhibition is alleviated by chemical inhibition of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG). A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is able to circumvent egress repression by PKA or pH neutralisation, indicating that environmental acidification and PKA signalling act as balancing regulators of cGMP degradation to control PKG-mediated egress. Collectively, these results reveal a cross-talk between PKA and PKG pathways to govern egress in T. gondii.",PXD006045,2017-10-12,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006045,PRIDE

Despite this optimisation, most members of a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family show genetic redundancy during erythrocytic proliferation. To identify relationships between phospho-signalling pathways, we here screen 294 genetic interactions among protein kinases in Plasmodium berghei. This reveals a synthetic negative interaction between a hypomorphic allele of the protein kinase G (PKG) and CDPK4 to control erythrocyte invasion which is conserved in P. falciparum. CDPK4 becomes critical when PKG-dependent calcium signals are attenuated to phosphorylate proteins important for the stability of the inner membrane complex, which serves as an anchor for the acto-myosin motor required for motility and invasion. Finally, we show that multiple kinases functionally complement CDPK4 during erythrocytic proliferation and transmission to the mosquito vector.

Upon ingestion, Plasmodium male gametocyte undergoes explosive development: within 10 minutes, it completes three rounds of genome replication and endomitosis, assembles eight axonemes, and emerges from the host red blood cell. The plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase 4 (CDPK4) was previously shown to be essential for male gametogenesis placing this kinase as an attractive drug target to block malaria transmission. Here we have identified and resolved three distinct molecular functions of CDPK4 during male gametogenesis. Activity of a myristoylated isoform is first required up to 20 seconds after activation to load the Mini-Chromosome Maintenance complex onto origins of replication. This role is partially mediated by a conserved protein belonging to the SAPS-domain family which is involved in the G1 to S-phase transition in eukaryotes. At the same time, activity of myristoylated CDPK4 is required to phosphorylate a Plasmodium-specific microtubule-associated protein necessary for mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, activity of a short non-myristoylated isoform of CDPK4 is essential seconds prior to completion of cytokinesis and the activation of male gamete motility. This late role has been linked to another Plasmodium-specific protein that is incorporated into axonemes during gametogenesis. This study reveals how a kinase of a protist parasite integrates and transduces multiple signals with a high spatiotemporal resolution to control both evolutionarily conserved and Plasmodium-specific biological processes.",PXD005884,2017-05-24,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD005884,PRIDE

The phosphorylation-based signalling mechanisms underlying the initiation of this process remain largely unmapped. We have measured a high-resolution time course of phosphorylation in P. berghei gametocytes during the first minute of gametogenesis to elucidate the scope and dynamics of the response. The data reveals rapid phosphoregulation of microtubule motor proteins and DNA replication initiation proteins within the first 18 s and of DNA replication machinery by 60 s. The data also implicate several protein kinases and phosphatases in the gametogenesis signalling pathway. Through gene knock-out experiments, we verify that the protein kinases CDPK4 and SRPK1 have distinct influences over the phosphorylation of similar downstream targets. Together, the results show that key cell-cycle systems related to both replication and mitosis undergo simultaneous, rapid phosphoregulation.",PXD006266,2017-11-29,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD006266,PRIDE

It integrates several international repeated surveys, with Swiss data going back as far as 1987. In practice, a minimum of 1,200 people answer a 1-hour face-to-face interview, with the survey being conducted every two years. The data offer valuable information about attitudes and behaviours of the resident population of Switzerland, with strong analytical power for sociological research.The questionnaire is structured in five parts: (1+2) At the heart of MOSAiCH stands the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). This longstanding survey includes today 45 countries all over the world. As the fieldwork of MOSAiCH takes place every two years, two modules of the ISSP are included in each survey. There are currently 12 different modules, regularly repeated for comparisons over time. (3) Thesocio-demographic part is designed to meet the ISSP requirements, and is further elaborated to improve the analytical power. (4) An additional part of the survey takes over certain repeated parts of the standard Eurobarometer, adapted to the Swiss context, especially the attitudes toward political and social institutions and issues related to the European Union. (5) A last part is open for propositions of Swissscholars, which have to be related to the topics of the fielded survey.For the edition in 2015, the ISSP modules are on the repeated topics “Citizenship (II)” and “Work orientations (IV)”. The questions for the last part have been determined by a call for proposals. The additional questions in the Face-to-Face questionnaire are related to National identity, gender role and work complexity. The drop-off questionnaire is related to family network.",https://doi.org/10.23662/FORS-DS-683-3,2016-02-01,https://forsbase.unil.ch/,FORSbase

Despite epidemiologic evidence implicating early life environment in risk for allergy, temporally controlled lineage-tracing of ILC2s during this period has not been done. Using complementary fate-mapping approaches and fluorescent reporters of ILC2 activation, we demonstrate that ILC2s appear in multiple organs during late gestation similar to tissue macrophages, but unlike the latter, a majority of peripheral ILC2 pools are generated de novo during a postnatal window. This period was accompanied by systemic ILC2 priming and acquisition of tissue-specific expression profiles. Although perinatal ILC2s are variably replaced with age, the dramatic increases in tissue ILC2s following helminth infection are mediated through local expansion independent of de novo generation by BM hematopoiesis. We provide the first comprehensive temporally controlled fate-mapping of an innate lymphocyte subset with notable nuances as compared to tissue macrophage ontogeny",GSE126924,2019-04-15,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126924,Gene Expression Omnibus

However, such samples are often beyond the reach of individual researchers or institutions, and studies are often limited to small numbers of species. Consequently, methodological and site-specific-differences across studies can limit comparisons between species. Here we introduce the ManyPrimates project, which addresses these challenges by providing a large-scale collaborative framework for comparative studies in primate cognition. To demonstrate the viability of the project we conducted a case study of short-term memory. In this initial study, we were able to include 176 individuals from 12 primate species housed at 11 sites across Africa, Asia, North America and Europe. All subjects were tested in a delayed-response task using consistent methodology across sites. Individuals could access food rewards by remembering the position of the hidden reward after a 0, 15, or 30-second delay. Overall, individuals performed better with shorter delays, as predicted by previous studies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong phylogenetic signal for short-term memory. Although, with only 12 species, the validity of this analysis is limited, our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of a large, collaborative open-science project. We present the ManyPrimates project as an exciting opportunity to address open questions in primate cognition and behaviour with large, diverse datasets.",tr6q3,2018-02-15,https://osf.io/tr6q3/,OSF

162732,231CB8FC-3264-480A-BAEB-695096D5E3A0,Data from: Adaptation to chronic nutritional stress leads to reduced dependence on microbiota in Drosophila melanogaster,"Numerous studies have shown that animal nutrition is tightly linked to gut microbiota, especially under nutritional stress. In Drosophila melanogaster, microbiota are known to promote juvenile growth, development, and survival on poor diets, mainly through enhanced digestion leading to changes in hormonal signaling. Here, we show that this reliance on microbiota is greatly reduced in replicated Drosophila populations that became genetically adapted to a poor larval diet in the course of over 170 generations of experimental evolution. Protein and polysaccharide digestion in these poor-diet-adapted populations became much less dependent on colonization with microbiota. This was accompanied by changes in expression levels of dFOXO transcription factor, a key regulator of cell growth and survival, and many of its targets. These evolutionary changes in the expression of dFOXO targets to a large degree mimic the response of the same genes to microbiota, suggesting that the evolutionary adaptation to poor diet acted on mechanisms that normally mediate the response to microbiota. Our study suggests that some metazoans have retained the evolutionary potential to adapt their physiology such that association with microbiota may become optional rather than essential.",doi:10.5061/dryad.td3r1,,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.td3r1,Dryad

162732,8893EE59-3AEF-40C6-9489-EBA2F2CE7408,Data from: Host diet mediates a negative relationship between abundance and diversity of Drosophila gut microbiota,"Nutrient supply to ecosystems has major effects on ecological diversity, but it is unclear to what degree the shape of this relationship is general versus dependent on the specific environment or community. Although the diet composition in terms of the source or proportions of different nutrient types is known to affect gut microbiota composition, the relationship between the quantity of nutrients supplied and the abundance and diversity of the intestinal microbial community remains to be elucidated. Here we address this relationship using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained over multiple generations on three diets differing in the concentration of yeast (the only source of most nutrients). While a 6.5-fold increase in yeast concentration led to a 100-fold increase in the total abundance of gut microbes, it caused a major decrease in their alpha diversity (by 45-60 % depending on the diversity measure). This was accompanied by only minor shifts in the taxonomic affiliation of the most common operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Thus, nutrient concentration in host diet mediates a strong negative relationship between the nutrient abundance and microbial diversity in the Drosophila gut ecosystem.",doi:10.5061/ dryad.t0554g0,,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.t0554g0,Dryad

We found that EC-specific loss of the glycolytic regulator pfkfb3 reduced ischemic hindlimb revascularization and impaired muscle regeneration. This was caused by the reduced ability of macrophages to adopt a proangiogenic and proregenerative M2-like phenotype. Mechanistically, loss of pfkfb3 reduced lactate secretion by ECs and lowered lactate levels in the ischemic muscle. Addition of lactate to pfkfb3-deficient ECs restored M2-like polarization in an MCT1-dependent fashion. Lactate shuttling by ECs enabled macrophages to promote proliferation and fusion of muscle progenitors. Moreover, VEGF production by lactate-polarized macrophages was increased, resulting in a positive feedback loop that further stimulated angiogenesis. Finally, increasing lactate levels during ischemia rescued macrophage polarization and improved muscle reperfusion and regeneration, whereas macrophage-specific mct1 deletion prevented M2-like polarization. In summary, ECs exploit glycolysis for angiocrine lactate shuttling to steer muscle regeneration from ischemia.",10.1016/j.cmet.2020.05.004,2020-06-01,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120302436?via%3Dihub#app2,Cell Metabolism

To understand how effective a software visualization is, it must be evaluated on that particular development task. We present an overview of the evaluation of existing visualizations, and examine their characteristics. In particular, we review the complete literature body of papers published in the SOFTVIS/VISSOFT conferences. Among the 387 papers published to date, we included in our study 181 full papers from which we extracted evaluation strategies, data collection methods and other various aspects of the evaluations. We found that 62% of the proposed software visualization approaches do not include an evaluation. We believe that for software visualization approaches to be adopted by developers, visualizations not only must prove their effectiveness via evaluations, but also evaluations should include participants of the target audience and real-world software systems. Finally, we recommend researchers in the field to conduct surveys that can help them to identify what are the frequent and complex problems that affect developers.",http://scg.unibe.ch/research/softvis-eval,,http://scg.unibe.ch/research/softvis-eval,A Systematic Literature Review of Software Visualization Evaluation

Zu diesem Zweck wird in der longitudinal angelegten Interventionsstudie ZEPPELIN die Frage untersucht, ob Massnahmen der selektiven primären Prävention ab Geburt die Bildungschancen von Kindern aus Familien in psychosozialen Risikokonstellationen erhöhen. Ausgangslage: In keinem europäischen Land ausser Deutschland sind die Bildungschancen derart eng mit der sozial-familialen Herkunft verbunden wie in der Schweiz (OECD, 2005), und in keinem anderen Land sind die Aussonderungsquoten von Schulkindern aus sozial benachteiligten Familien so hoch (European Agency, 2010). Die in der Schweiz ergriffenen schulischen Massnahmen zur Förderung von Kindern mit ungünstigen Lernvoraussetzungen zeigten bislang nur wenig Wirkung (Moser & Lanfranchi, 2008). Daher soll das Grundproblem der herkunftsbedingten Bildungsdisparitäten bereits im frühkindlichen Alter angegangen werden, weshalb sich unser Fokus auf die Vorbeugung schulischer Lern- und Leistungsstörungen aufgrund ungünstiger Startbedingungen verschiebt. Ins Blickfeld rücken Massnahmen zur frühkindlichen Bildung, Betreuung und Erziehung (FBBE). Bei Kleinkindern geschieht das primär über die Stärkung elterlicher Erziehungskompetenzen. Ziele: ZEPPELIN ist ein Interventionsprojekt der Hochschule für Heilpädagogik Zürich (HfH) in Zusammenarbeit mit der Bildungsdirektion des Kantons Zürich (Amt für Jugend und Berufsberatung, AJB) im Bereich der selektiven primären Prävention. Erstes Ziel im Rahmen der Intervention ist die interdisziplinäre Früherkennung von Kindern, die aus psychosozialen Gründen in ihrer Entwicklung gefährdet und insofern von Behinderung bedroht sind. Das zweite Ziel ist die frühe Förderung dieser Kinder mit dem Programm ""PAT - Mit Eltern lernen"", um ihre Bildungschancen langfristig zu erhöhen. Im Rahmen der Wirkungsevaluation wird geprüft, inwiefern diese beiden Ziele erreicht werden. Fragestellung: In Anlehnung an das PPCT-Design nach Bronfenbrenner und Morris (2006) - in welchem Entwicklung als Interaktion zwischen Person und Umwelt im Kontext sozialräumlicher und zeitlicher Bedingungen aufgefasst wird - steht bei ZEPPELIN 0-3 die Frage im Zentrum, welche Effekte Massnahmen der frühen Förderung auf die Entwicklung von 0 bis 3-jährigen Kindern aus Familien in psychosozialen Risikokonstellationen haben und über welche Wirkmechanismen im Bildungsort Familie allfällige Effekte zum Tragen kommen. Vorgehen Intervention: Aufbauend auf den Erfahrungen aus der (gegenwärtig laufenden) Machbarkeitsstudie ZEPPELIN/M soll in der Hauptstudie ZEPPELIN 0-3 zur Früherkennung von Familien in psychosozialen Risikokonstellationen ein interdisziplinäres Netzwerk implementiert werden, das sich aus Akteuren aus dem medizinischen und psychosozialen Versorgungsfeld zusammensetzt. Zur frühen Förderung dieser Familien haben wir das Programm PAT gewählt, das die wichtigsten Kriterien wirksamer FBBE-Programme erfüllt: a) frühzeitiger Beginn, b) Kontinuität, c) Individualisierungsmöglichkeiten, d) Professionalität des Personals, e) Berücksichtigung der Sprachförderung und f) niederschwelliger Zugang mittels Hausbesuchen. Vorgehen Forschung: Um obige Fragestellung zu beantworten und die Zielerreichung zu überprüfen, ist ZEPPELIN längsschnittlich angelegt. In einer randomisiert kontrollierten Versuchanordnung (RCT) sollen qualitative und quantitative Verfahren eingesetzt werden, um mittels Vergleichen zwischen Interventions- (N=132) und Kontrollgruppe (N=84) Effekte auf die Entwicklung der Kinder und die Wirkmechanismen im Bildungsort Familie zu evaluieren. Folgende Instrumente sind bei ZEPPELIN 0-3 geplant: Zwischen dem 3. und 6. Lebensmonat eine Einschätzung der Belastungs- und Schutzfaktoren; ab dem 3. Lebensmonat Videoanalysen zur Ermittlung der Qualität der Eltern-Kind-Interaktionen; rund um die ersten drei Geburtstage der Kinder jeweils Entwicklungstests, Skalen zur Einschätzung der elterlichen Versorgungskompetenz, der Erziehungseinstellung und des Anregungsgehalts im häuslichen Umfeld. Es ist vorgesehen, die Studie longitudinal weiterzuführen und Messungen bis in die SEK I vorzunehmen (ZEPPELIN 6-7; 12-13). Relevanz: ZEPPELIN ist zum einen aktuell, da frühe Förderung benachteiligter Kinder regelmässig auf der bildungs- und familienpolitischen Agenda steht. Zum anderen ist ZEPPELIN aufgrund der bestehenden Forschungslücken in der Schweiz relevant und originär, da hier zum ersten Mal ein FBBE-Programm zielgruppenspezifisch ab Geburt durchgeführt und in einer experimentellen Feldstudie evaluiert wird.

Sulfuric acid is detected in the mass spectrometer either as a deprotonated ion or as a cluster with the reagent ion (NO3-). The concentration is calculated as the area of these two peaks normalized to the concentration of the reagent ions (monomer, dimer and trimer) and multiplied by a calibration factor that was experimentally derived at Paul Scherrer Institute in the summer 2017, after the campaign. In the atmosphere, sulfuric acid is produced by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide that could have both a natural or anthropogenic origin (e.g. phytoplankton emission or fossil fuel combustion). Sulfuric acid in the atmosphere is responsible for a very large fraction of the newly formed particles, therefore it is important to have accurate measurements of this vapour in remote places like the Southern Ocean to better understand secondary aerosol sources and processes.The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from January 22, 2017 to March 19, 2017. There are no data for the first leg of the expedition because the instrument was not on the ship. The instrument was operated during leg 4 but data has not been processed yet as they require additional work due to some instrumental issues that affects their quality. Data were collected with one-second time resolution but integrated to five minutes to increase the signal to noise ratio.Concentrations are reported as molecules per cubic centimeter. The lower limit of detection is in the ppq (part per quadrillion) range but was not determined exactly as it varies with the integration time and background noise.",10.5281/zenodo.3265832,2019-08-07,https://zenodo.org/record/3265832#.XvWXp9XKFhE,Zenodo

The diameter range is 0.7 to 19 µm. Particles in this size range are indicative of primary sea spray aerosol, biological particles and potentially long-range transported mineral dust. These particles are also important for cloud formation as they act as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles, the latter especially in the case of biological particles and mineral dust.Typically the instrument reports data starting from particles with a diameter greater than 500 nm, however, particle number concentrations in the channels below 723 nm were overestimated, which is a common artefact with this instrument.The data have been cleaned from the influence of the exhaust of the research vessel. Temporal coverage is from December 20, 2016 to April 10, 2017. We give five-minute averaged data as dN/dlog(dp), where dN is the particle number concentration per measured size bin normalized over the logarithm of the bin width. The bin width is defined as the distance between two diameters. They are spaced equally in log-space with dlog(dp) = log(d_n+1/d_n) = 1/32. To derive the total particle number concentration one has to integrate over the diameter range taking into account the normalization by dlog(dp).",10.5281/zenodo.2636709,2019-06-19,https://zenodo.org/record/2636709#.XvWaGdXKFhE,Zenodo

Ultrafast electron microscopy has recently made free-electron beams the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation and characterization 6-11 , enabling the observation of free-electron quantum walks 12-14 , attosecond electron pulses 10,15-17 and holographic electromagnetic imaging 18 . Chip-based photonics 19,20 promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing but remains to be realized in electron microscopy. Here we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator. The high-finesse ( Q0 ≈ 10 6 ) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron-light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled power of only 5.35 microwatts and generate >500 electron energy sidebands for several milliwatts. Moreover, we probe unidirectional intracavity fields with microelectronvolt resolution in electron-energy-gain spectroscopy 21 . The fibre-coupled photonic structures feature single-optical-mode electron-light interaction with full control over the input and output light. This approach establishes a versatile and highly efficient framework for enhanced electron beam control in the context of laser phase plates 22 , beam modulators and continuous-wave attosecond pulse trains 23 , resonantly enhanced spectroscopy 24-26 and dielectric laser acceleration 19,20,27 . Our work introduces a universal platform for exploring free-electron quantum optics 28-31 , with potential future developments in strong coupling, local quantum probing and electron-photon entanglement.",10.5281/zenodo.5575752,2021-12-23,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5575752,ZENODO

Point measurements, though, do not represent the high spatial variability of snow depths present in alpine terrain. Photogrammetric mapping techniques have progressed in recent years and are capable of accurately mapping snow depth in a spatially continuous manner, over larger areas, and at various spatial resolutions. However, the strengths and weaknesses associated with specific platforms and photogrammetric techniques, as well as the accuracy of the photogrammetric performance on snow surfaces have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, industry-standard photogrammetric platforms, including high-resolution satellites (Pléiades), airplane (Ultracam Eagle M3), Unmanned Aerial System (eBee+ with S.O.D.A. camera) and terrestrial (single lens reflex camera, Canon EOS 750D), were tested for snow depth mapping in the alpine Dischma valley (Switzerland) in spring 2018. Imagery was acquired with airborne and space-borne platforms over the entire valley, while Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and terrestrial photogrammetric imagery was acquired over a subset of the valley. For independent validation of the photogrammetric products, snow depth was measured by probing, as well as using remote observations of fixed snow poles.When comparing snow depth maps with manual and snow pole measurements the root mean square error (RMSE) values and the normalized median deviation (NMAD) values were 0.52 m and 0.47 m respectively for the satellite snow depth map, 0.17 m and 0.17 m for the airplane snow depth map, 0.16 m and 0.11 m for the UAS snow depth map. The area covered by the terrestrial snow depth map only intersected with 4 manual measurements and did not generate statistically relevant measurements. When using the UAS snow depth map as a reference surface, the RMSE and NMAD values were 0.44 m and 0.38 m for the satellite snow depth map, 0.12 m and 0.11 m for the airplane snow depth map, 0.21 and 0.19 m for the terrestrial snow depth map. When compared to the airplane dataset over a large part of the Dischma valley (40 km2), the snow depth map from the satellite yielded a RMSE value of 0.92 m and a NMAD value of 0.65 m. This study provides comparative measurements between photogrammetric platforms to evaluate their specific advantages and disadvantages for operational, spatially continuous snow depth mapping in alpine terrain over both small and large geographic areas.",10.16904/envidat.189,2020-11-11,https://www.envidat.ch/#/metadata/intercomparison-of-photogrammetric-platforms,ENVIDAT

However, obtaining samples for traditional methods involves capture and restraint of animals, and/or pain, which can influence the animal’s stress level, and thereby undesirable release of hormones. Here, we measured corticosterone, testosterone and progesterone in the hair of 482 wild-derived house mice that experienced sexual competition while living under semi-natural conditions. We tested whether sex, age, weight and indicators of sexual maturity, reproduction and social conflicts predict hormone concentrations measured in hair (sampling at endpoint). We show that body weight, sex and age significantly predict cumulative testosterone and progesterone levels, allowing the differentiation between subadults and adults in both sexes. Corticosterone was only slightly elevated in older males compared to older females and increased with the level of visible injuries or scars. Testosterone in males positively correlated with body weight, age, testes size, and sperm number. Progesterone in females significantly increased with age, body weight, and the number of embryos implanted throughout life, but not with the number of litters when controlled for age and weight. Our results highlight the biological validity of hair steroid measurements and provide important insight into reproductive competition in wild house mice.",10.5061/dryad.x95x69pd6,2019-12-15,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.x95x69pd6,Dryad

173124,0DBA3C87-9C5C-49B0-9AB2-08728EE077B4,Three free plugins that expand the built-in hyperstack analysis functionality of the freely available ImageJ program,"1) ImageJ Plugin: Gaussian Filter 5DA simple 5D Gaussian filter plugin for signal processing. This was currently missing from the default ImageJ tools, since the built-in 3D filter functionality does not fully support filtering higher-order stacks (such as combined z+t). The current plugin is natively capable of processing a 5-D stack, and is able to filter in all dimensions (except across channels). A DC offset option is provided to blank arbitrary noise values below a selectable threshold.2) ImageJ Plugin: MultiROI TZ ProfilerA multi-ROI trace plotter allowing for interactive, real-time exploration of the 5D data by the user. This expands the functionality of the built-in “Z-axis profiler” tool set up by the NIH developers (Baler and Rasband, 2003) which allows for plotting the average ROI signal through space or time. Using the Z-axis profiler code as a starting base, we added the multi-ROI (multi-trace) capability, as well as the capability of adding an externally loaded trace (e.g., an electrophysiology trace) to the plot. A number of other user-friendly options such as filtered trace overlay, color-coding and various display normalization options, are also provided via an extra interface window. The plugin implements dynamic update capability, allowing the user to move and modify ROIs, change channels and focal planes, and see the resulting trace changes in real time.3) ImageJ Plugin: Cross-Correlation CalculatorA cross-correlation plugin that performs a comprehensive list of voxel-by-voxel calculations through time in search of temporal correlation versus either an externally loaded trace, a binarized stimulus waveform, or an individual ROI extract. This allows for the easy identification of putatively time-locked regions within a 3D imaging volume. To improve the performance under the jittering response conditions, cumulative cross-correlation (area under the curve) is available in addition to the normal peak calculation. In our studies, we have applied this plugin to axonal stimulation paradigms (minimal stimulations) in the dentate gyrus and have thereby identified several regions within an astrocyte that reliably responded to the stimuli. Such regions corresponded to a fraction of <1% of the total analyzed astrocytic volume (Bindocci et al., 2017).",DOI,2019-01-29,https://github.com/volterralab,Github

Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Photometric analysis of β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, PZ Tel B, and HD 206893 B","Context. Directly imaged planets and substellar companions are key targets for the characterization of self-luminous atmospheres. Their photometric appearance at 4-5 μ m is sensitive to the chemical composition and cloud content of their atmosphere. Aims. We aim to systematically characterize the atmospheres of directly imaged low-mass companions at 4-5 μ m. We want to homogeneously process the data, provide robust flux measurements, and compile a photometric library at thermal wavelengths of these mostly young, low-gravity objects. In this way, we want to find trends related to their spectral type and surface gravity by comparing with isolated brown dwarfs and predictions from atmospheric models. Methods. We used the high-resolution, high-contrast capabilities of NACO at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to directly image the companions of HIP 65426, PZ Tel, and HD 206893 in the NB4.05 and/or M ′ filters. For the same targets, and additionally β Pic, we also analyzed six archival VLT/NACO datasets which were taken with the NB3.74, L ′, NB4.05, and M ′ filters. The data processing and photometric extraction of the companions was done with PynPoint while the species toolkit was used to further analyze and interpret the fluxes and colors. Results. We detect for the first time HIP 65426 b, PZ Tel B, and HD 206893 B in the NB4.05 filter, PZ Tel B and HD 206893 B in the M ′ filter, and β Pic b in the NB3.74 filter. We provide calibrated magnitudes and fluxes with a careful analysis of the error budget, both for the new and archival datasets. The L ′-NB4.05 and L ′- M ′ colors of the studied sample are all red while the NB4.05- M ′ color is blue for β Pic b, gray for PZ Tel B, and red for HIP 65426 b and HD 206893 B (although typically with low significance). The absolute NB4.05 and M ′ fluxes of our sample are all larger than those of field dwarfs with similar spectral types. Finally, the surface gravity of β Pic b has been constrained to log g = 4.17 −0.13+0.10 dex from its photometry and dynamical mass. Conclusions. A red color at 3-4 μ m and a blue color at 4-5 μ m might be (partially) caused by H 2 O and CO absorption, respectively, which are expected to be the most dominant gaseous opacities in hot ( Teff ≳ 1300 K) atmospheres. The red characteristics of β Pic b, HIP 65426 b, and HD 206893 B at 3-5 μ m, as well as their higher fluxes in NB4.05 and M ′ compared to field dwarfs, indicate that cloud densities are enhanced close to the photosphere as a result of their low surface gravity.",10.1051/0004-6361/201937159,2020-03-31,http://telbib.eso.org/detail.php?bibcode=2020A%26A...635A.182S,ESO archive

Various positive effects of oEVs on gametes and early embryos have been found in vitro. To find out if these effects are associated with changes of embryonic gene expression, the embryonic transcriptome was analyzed after supplementation of bovine embryos with bovine oEVs during in vitro culture (IVC) in comparison to corresponding controls without oEVs. Embryos were cultured during 7 days of IVC with fresh oEVs, oEVs frozen after isolation from oviductal fluid or without oEVs (control), since a previous study showed different effects of fresh and frozen oEVs. Five pools of 10-14 embryos were analyzed for each group by low-input Illumina RNA-sequencing. Analysis of differential gene expression revealed 221 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the comparison of frozen oEVs vs control, 67 DEGs for fresh vs frozen oEVs, and only minor differences for the comparison fresh oEVs vs control (28 DEGs). An integrative analysis with the previously studied mRNA and small ncRNA content of bovine oEVs suggested direct effects of oEVs content on the embryonic transcriptome for the supplementation with frozen oEVs, i.e., increase of transcripts found in higher concentrations in oEVs and decrease of transcripts which are potential targets of miRNAs found in oEVs.Overall design Supplementation of bovine embryos during in vitro culture with fresh or frozen bovine oviductal EVs and untreated controls, low-input total RNA-seq of 5 replicates (pools of 8-14 embryos) per group using Illumina HiSeq 2500.",GSE143596,2020-03-21,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143596,NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus

This finding called for the analysis of cell type-specific gene expression in the endometrium in response to the equine embryo, which could be the key for improved understanding of gene expression regulation in context of MRP. In a pilot study, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to collect samples of the luminal epithelium (LE), glandular epithelium (GE), and stroma from endometrial biopsies taken from five mares on Day 12 of pregnancy and Day 12 of the estrous cycle, respectively. RNA was isolated from the LCM samples in order to perform RNA sequencing. Data analysis showed that gene expression differences were greater between cell types than between pregnant and cyclic state. Differential gene expression between pregnant and cyclic state was mainly found in the LE but also in GE and stroma. The comparison with a previous RNA-Seq data set for whole biopsy samples derived from Day 12 of pregnancy revealed the specific origin of the observed gene expression differences. Furthermore, we found that a number of genes are specifically differentially expressed (DE) in only one cell type. Some genes not DE when looking at the whole biopsy were DE in one cell type and showed similar levels in the other cell types in comparison of pregnancy and cyclic stage. Overall, this study revealed new and important spatial information about endometrial gene expression during the phase of initial recognition of pregnancy in the mare. The results indicated induction of angiogenesis and blood vessel development by the presence of the conceptus, a specific spatial regulation of the immune system, spatial regulation of growth factors controlling cell differentiation and endometrial remodeling, and regulation of genes involved in production of prostaglandin (PG) precursors, PG transport, and PG receptors, specifically PTGFR in context of prevention of luteolysis. Furthermore, these results support our hypothesis of the existence of a specific response in different endometrial cell types in the mare and call for further studies.Overall design: Messenger RNA profiles of laser capture microdissection samples (luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium, stroma) from equine endometrial biopsies collected on Day 12 of pregnancy and Day 12 of estrous cycle, respectively, from in total 6 healthy mares were generated by RNA-sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500.",GSE112236,2018-09-30,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112236,NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus

However, little is known about the uterine EVs in the mare. Therefore, the present study aimed at characterizing EVs from uterine lavage of cyclic mares by comparing five EVs isolation methods and the combination of them: (1) Ultracentrifugation (UC); (2) Concentration of lavage volume by Centricon ultrafiltration (CE); (3) the use of CE with different washing steps (PBS versus trehalose); (4) Size-exclusion chromatography with iZON-qEV columns to yield high-purity EVs and (5) a combination of the methods with best results based on EVs yield, purity, and protein cargo profiles. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting confirmed the isolation of EVs by all methods but with quantitative and qualitative differences. Mass spectrometry provided different protein profiles among methods with marked differences in the number of proteins and protein classes. Our results indicate that the combination of CE/trehalose/iZON/UC is an optimal method to isolate equine uterine EVs with good yield and purity that can be applied in future studies to determine the role of uterine EVs during MRP in the mare.",PXD022264,2021-09-09,http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD022264,PRIDE

The STOP cassette consists of three identical SV40-derived poly(A) signal repeats and is flanked by two loxP sites. We found that in addition to complete loxP-mediated recombination, limiting levels of the Cre recombinase also cause incomplete recombination of the STOP cassette. Partial recombination leads to the loss of only one or two of the three identical poly(A) repeats with recombination breakpoints always precisely matching the end/start of each poly(A) signal repeat without any relevant similarity to the canonical or known cryptic loxP sequences, suggesting that this type of Cre-mediated recombination is loxP-independent. Incomplete deletion of the STOP cassette results in partial read-through transcription, explaining at least some of the variability often observed in marker gene expression from an otherwise identical locus.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bk3j9kd7t,2020-06-10,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bk3j9kd7t,Dryad

First described as a component of intercellular junctions, it has remained unresolved whether this near-ubiquitously expressed protein acts as a genuine transcriptional regulator in adult tissue like its closest relative β-catenin. Here we have mapped the global gene targets of PG by ChIP-chip in differentiating skin keratinocytes. Applying a peak algorithm, over 5’000 high-confidence PG target promoters were identified and 2’000 for β-catenin with an overlap of 38%.Bioinformatics analyses most significantly associated PG target genes with the Wnt signaling pathway as well as relevant pathways for keratinocyte differentiation. Using a combination of wild-type, PG, β-catenin and PG/β-catenin double null keratinocytes, PG was functionally validated as a LEF/TCF-dependent transcriptional regulator. These data challenge the current understanding of Wnt signaling, one of the most important pathways in tissue homeostasis, by identifying PG as a potent LEF/TCF-dependent transcriptional regulator which functionally overlaps with β-catenin.",200037343,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37343,GEO DataSets

Nine different aerosol sources were identified during both winters using positive matrix factorization (PMF), including dust, brake wear, a S-rich factor, two solid fuel combustion (SFC) factors and four industrial/combustion factors related to plume events (Cr-30 Ni-Mn, Cu-Cd-Pb, Pb-Sn-Se and Cl-Br-Se). Most of these sources had the highest relative contributions during late night (22:00 local time (LT)) and early morning hours (between 03:00 to 08:00 LT), which is consistent with enhanced emissions into a shallow boundary layer.

To investigate the in vivo role of an increased cardiac content of RKIP, we generated transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of RKIP (PEBP1; phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1) under control of the alpha-MHC promoter in B6 (C57BL/6J) background. Because RKIP is a dual-specific GRK2 and Raf kinase inhibitor, RKIP-transgenic mice were compared to transgenic mice with myocardium-specific expression of the GRK2 inhibitor, GRK2-K220R, which is a kinase-inactive GRK2 (ADRBK1) mutant with dominant-negative function. In frame of our studies, we found that RKIP-transgenic mice developed signs of heart failure and cardiotoxic lipid load at an age of 8 months. In contrast, transgenic expression of GRK2-K220R improved cardiac function and protected against chronic pressure overload-induced symptoms of heart failure. To identify genes related to cardiotoxic lipid load, we further determined the cardiac gene expression profile of Tg-SCD1 mice with mypcardium-specific expression of SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) and Tg-UCP1 mice with heart-specific expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1).",GSE120020,2018-09-16,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120020,NCBI GEO

This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 12 clustering algorithms, including both methods developed explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using 9 publicly available scRNA-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves. We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering. The R scripts providing an extensible framework for the evaluation of new methods and data sets are available on GitHub ( https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/scRNAseq_clustering_comparison ).",https://zenodo.org/record/1314743,2018-07-26,https://zenodo.org/record/1314743,Zenodo

One established function is to acknowledgeexisting dominance relationships. At the same time, call rates often increase during social tension,suggesting additional functions, such as to appease higher-ranking individuals, or to maintain spatialproximity and friendly relations. For vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, vocal behaviour has beenstudied extensively, but little research has been devoted to calls given during encounters between twoindividuals, i.e. grunts. Here, we examined how individual and relationship features affected the vocalgreeting behaviour of wild vervet monkeys in different ecological and social situations. We used aninformation theory approach to investigate the functional hypotheses of vervet monkeys' vocal greetingsignals. We found little support for the main functions proposed in the literature, that is, to signalsubmission, to avoid conflicts, to test social bonds or to coordinate group activity. Results supported theuse of grunts to signal benign intent, and we found that grunts were mostly given to closely bondedmales near rivers, suggesting that vervet monkeys use vocal greeting signals to recruit individuals insituations of danger to reduce predation risk.",https://figshare.com/s/259509e0b8b29fe81b90,2017-10-01,https://figshare.com/s/259509e0b8b29fe81b90,Figshare

179155,56A8E9E5-7AE5-4465-959F-42EAF70D8321,Probing Quantum Confinement and Electronic Structure at Polar Oxide Interfaces,"Polar discontinuities occurring at interfaces between two materials constitute both a challenge and an opportunity in the study and application of a variety of devices. In order to cure the large electric field occurring in such structures, a reconfiguration of the charge landscape sets in at the interface via chemical modifications, adsorbates, or charge transfer. In the latter case, one may expect a local electronic doping of one material: one example is the two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) appearing in SrTiO3 once covered by a polar LaAlO3 layer. Here, it is shown that tuning the formal polarization of a (La,Al)1−x(Sr,Ti)xO3 (LASTO:x) overlayer modifies the quantum confinement of the 2DEL in SrTiO3 and its electronic band structure. The analysis of the behavior in magnetic field of superconducting field-effect devices reveals, in agreement with ab initio calculations and self-consistent Poisson-Schrödinger modeling, that quantum confinement and energy splitting between electronic bands of different symmetries strongly depend on the interface total charge densities. These results strongly support the polar discontinuity mechanisms with a full charge transfer to explain the origin of the 2DEL at the celebrated LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface and demonstrate an effective tool for tailoring the electronic structure at oxide interfaces.",10.26037/yareta:67wx2i7mpjg4nh6gjbtroxfdpy,2018-06-24,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:67wx2i7mpjg4nh6gjbtroxfdpy,Yareta

We find a striking difference between films grown on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates which appears to stem not only from the difference in epitaxial strain state but also from the level of continuity at the heterointerface. In particular, the chemically and structurally discontinuous LaNiO3/SrTiO3 and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces cause a large variation in the octahedral network as a function of film thickness whereas the rather continuous LaNiO3/LaAlO3 interface seems to allow from just a few unit cells the formation of a stable octahedral pattern corresponding to that expected only given the applied biaxial strain.",10.26037/yareta:my3bdfiovfhunannc4slmmikwu,2019-05-22,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:my3bdfiovfhunannc4slmmikwu,Yareta

The data were generated and analyzed during a study of the strain tuning of the optical properties of LaNiO3 films.Abstract: Materials with strong electronic correlations host remarkable -- and technologically relevant -- phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions. Harnessing and controlling these effects is a major challenge, on which key advances are being made through lattice and strain engineering in thin films and heterostructures, leveraging the complex interplay between electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we show that the electronic structure of LaNiO3 can be tuned by means of lattice engineering. We use different substrates to induce compressive and tensile biaxial epitaxial strain in LaNiO3 thin films. Our measurements reveal systematic changes of the optical spectrum as a function of strain and, notably, an increase of the low-frequency free carrier weight as tensile strain is applied. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that this apparently counter-intuitive effect is due to a change of orientation of the oxygen octahedra.The calculations also reveal drastic changes of the electronic structure under strain, associated with a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition. We provide an online applet to explore these effects. The experimental value of integrated spectral weight below 2 eV is significantly (up to a factor of 3) smaller than the DFT results, indicating a transfer of spectral weight from the infrared to energies above 2 eV. The suppression of the free carrier weight and the transfer of spectral weight to high energies together indicate a correlation-induced band narrowing and free carrier mass enhancement due to electronic correlations.

Here, we report a structural and spectroscopy study of LaAlO3/SrTiO3/LaAlO3 trilayers grown on the SrTiO3 substrate by pulsed-laser deposition.  Scanning transmission electron microscopy with the help of ab initio calculations reveals that antisite defects associated with oxygen vacancies are primarily present in the SrTiO3 film (STO-f) close to the p-type interface (STO-f/LaAlO3), while oxygen vacancies prevail close to the top n-type interface (LaAlO3/STO-f). At the same interface, misfit dislocations relax the tensile strain of the top LaAlO3 layer. Combining x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray linear dichroism, resonant photoemission spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we observe that the 3d orbital reconstruction at the interface between LaAlO3 and the SrTiO3 substrate is confined over a few interfacial Ti planes while, at the top n-type interface (LaAlO3/STO-f), the absence of a dichroic signal can be related to the blurring of the interfacial orbital reconstruction due to the heterogeneity of defects.",10.26037/yareta:clk5af36yjgkdocrwb4nw5h574,2020-04-01,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:clk5af36yjgkdocrwb4nw5h574,Yareta

In this paper, we investigate the scattering-type scanning near field optical microscopy as a tool for studying the conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface from room temperature down to 6 K. We show that the near-field optical signal, in particular its phase component, is highly sensitive to the transport properties of the electron system present at the interface. Our modeling reveals that such sensitivity originates from the interaction of the AFM tip with coupled plasmon-phonon modes with a small penetration depth. The model allows us to quantitatively correlate changes in the optical signal with the variation of the 2DES transport properties induced by cooling and by electrostatic gating. To probe the spatial resolution of the technique, we image conducting nano-channels written in insulating heterostructures with a voltage-biased tip of an atomic force microscope.",10.26037/yareta:cgvjv45ogffi3obuwfizlgvfty,2020-12-01,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:cgvjv45ogffi3obuwfizlgvfty,Yareta

Here, we demonstrate that this can be accomplished by using scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron energy-loss spectroscopy. By tracking how the O K and Ni L edge fine structures evolve across two different NdNiO3/SmNiO3 superlattices, displaying either one or two metal-insulator transitions depending on the individual layer thickness, we are able to determine the electronic state of each of the individual constituent materials. We further map the spatial configuration associated with their metallic/insulating regions, reaching unit cell spatial resolution. With this, we estimate the width of the metallic/insulating boundaries at the NdNiO3/SmNiO3 interfaces, which is measured to be on the order of four unit cells.",10.26037/yareta:b5gpx2lvzjdpjo5pc7upmp3bjy,2021-03-08,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:b5gpx2lvzjdpjo5pc7upmp3bjy,Yareta

A well-known example is the metal-insulator transition, which has been shown to be highly controllable. However, the length scale over which these phases can be established is not yet well understood. To gain insight into this issue, we atomically engineered an artificially phase-separated system through fabricating epitaxial superlattices that consist of SmNiO3 and NdNiO3, two materials that undergo a metal-to-insulator transition at different temperatures. We demonstrate that the length scale of the interfacial coupling between metal and insulator phases is determined by balancing the energy cost of the boundary between a metal and an insulator and the bulk phase energies. Notably, we show that the length scale of this effect exceeds that of the physical coupling of structural motifs, which introduces a new framework for interface-engineering properties at temperatures against the bulk energetics.",10.26037/yareta:ese7b2ms6vbf3despucbkrlzla,2020-08-10,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:ese7b2ms6vbf3despucbkrlzla,Yareta

Müller","SrTiO3 is an insulating material which, using chemical doping, pressure, strain or isotope substitution, can be turned into a ferroelectric material or into a superconductor. The material itself, and the two aforementioned phenomena, have been subjects of intensive research of Karl Alex Müller and have been a source of inspiration, among other things, for his Nobel prize-winning research on high temperature superconductivity. An intriguing outstanding question is whether the occurrence of ferroelectricity and superconductivity in the same material is just a coincidence, or whether a deeper connection exists. In addition there is the empirical question of how these two phenomena interact with each other. Here we show that it is possible to induce superconductivity in a two-dimensional layer at the interface of SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 when we make the SrTiO3 ferroelectric by means of18 O substitution. Our experiments indicate that the ferroelectricity is perfectly compatible with having a superconducting two-dimensional electron system at the interface.

Here, we report the chemical synthesis and testing of Caulobacter ethensis-2.0 ( C. eth-2.0 ), a rewritten bacterial genome composed of the most fundamental functions of a bacterial cell. We rebuilt the essential genome of Caulobacter crescentus through the process of chemical synthesis rewriting and studied the genetic information content at the level of its essential genes. Within the 785,701-bp genome, we used sequence rewriting to reduce the number of encoded genetic features from 6,290 to 799. Overall, we introduced 133,313 base substitutions, resulting in the rewriting of 123,562 codons. We tested the biological functionality of the genome design in C. crescentus by transposon mutagenesis. Our analysis revealed that 432 essential genes of C. eth-2.0 , corresponding to 81.5% of the design, are equal in functionality to natural genes. These findings suggest that neither changing mRNA structure nor changing the codon context have significant influence on biological functionality of synthetic genomes. Discovery of 98 genes that lost their function identified essential genes with incorrect annotation, including a limited set of 27 genes where we uncovered noncoding control features embedded within protein-coding sequences.

160328,A9E7D3AF-773D-44AB-9FDB-25A9F4058175,A selfish genetic element linked to increased lifespan impacts metabolism in female house mice,"Gene drive systems can lead to the evolution of traits that further enhance the transmission of the driving element. In gene drive, one allele is transmitted to offspring at a higher frequency than the homologous allele. This has a range of consequences, which generally include a reduction in fitness of the carrier of the driving allele, making such systems selfish. The t haplotype is one such driver, found in house mice. It is linked to a reduction in litter size in matings among heterozygous animals, but also to increased lifespan in wild females that carry it. Here, we tested whether carrying the t haplotype was associated with altered resting metabolic rate (RMR). We show that females carrying the t haplotype decrease RMR as they increase in size, compared to wildtype females or males of either genotype. Our study elucidates a plausible mechanism by which a selfish genetic element increases lifespan.",10.5061/dryad.k71rd89,2019-12-17,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.k71rd89,Dryad

Here we present dual stable isotopic methane records (d13CH4 and dD(CH4)) from four Antarctic ice cores, which provide improved constraints on past changes in natural methane sources. Our isotope data show that tropical wetlands and seasonally inundated floodplains are most likely the controlling sources of atmospheric methane variations for the current and two older interglacials and their preceding glacial maxima. The changes in these sources are steered by variations in temperature, precipitation and the water table, as modulated by insolation, (local) sea level and monsoon intensity. Based on our new dD(CH4) constraint, it appears that geologic emissions of methane may play a steady but only minor role in atmospheric CH4 changes, and that the glacial budget is not dominated by these sources. Superimposed on the glacial/interglacial variations is a marked difference in both isotope records, with systematically higher values during the last 25,000 years compared to older time periods. This shift cannot be explained by climatic changes. Rather, our isotopic methane budget points to a marked increase in fire activity, possibly due to biome changes and accumulation of fuel related to the late Pleistocene megafauna extinction, which took place in the course of the last glacial.",https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.873918,2017-06-01,https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.873918,PANGAEA

Here, we compile 55 published model studies (consisting of 778 individual simulations) that assess the impact of six forcing mechanisms on millennial-scale CO2,atm variations: changes in freshwater supply to the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, the strength and position of the southern-hemisphere westerlies, Antarctic sea ice extent, and aeolian dust fluxes. We generally find agreement on the direction of simulated CO2,atm change across simulations, but the amplitude of change is inconsistent, primarily due to the different complexities of the model representation of Earth system processes. When freshwater is added to the North Atlantic, a reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is generally accompanied by an increase in Southern Ocean- and Pacific overturning, reduced Antarctic sea ice extent, spatially varying export production, and changes in carbon storage in the Atlantic (rising), in other ocean basins (generally decreasing) and on land (more varied). Positive or negative CO2,atm changes are simulated during AMOC minima due to a spatially and temporally varying dominance of individual terrestrial and oceanic drivers (and compensating effects between them) across the different models. In contrast, AMOC recoveries are often accompanied by rising CO2,atm levels, which are mostly driven by ocean carbon release (albeit from different regions). The magnitude of simulated CO2,atm rise broadly scales with the duration of the AMOC perturbation (i.e., the stadial length). When freshwater is added to the Southern Ocean, reduced deep-ocean ventilation drives a CO2,atm drop via reduced carbon release from the Southern Ocean. Although the impacts of shifted southern-hemisphere westerlies are inconsistent across model simulations, their intensification raises CO2,atm via enhanced Southern Ocean Ekman pumping. Increased supply of aeolian dust to the ocean, and thus iron fertilisation of marine productivity, consistently lowers modelled CO2,atm concentrations via more efficient nutrient utilisation. The magnitude of CO2,atm change in response to dust flux variations, however, largely depends on the complexity of models' marine ecosystem and iron cycle. This especially applies to simulations forced by Antarctic sea ice changes, in which the direction of simulated CO2,atm change varies greatly across model hierarchies. Our compilation highlights that no single (forcing) mechanism can explain observed past millennial-scale CO2,atm variability, and identifies important future needs in coupled carbon cycle-climate modelling to better understand the mechanisms governing CO2,atm changes in the past.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.05.013.,2016-05-15,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.05.013,Quaternary Science reviews

Since the available data from ice cores are discontinuous and partly ambiguous a well-documented decision process during data compilation followed by some interpolating post-processing are necessary to obtain those desired time series. Here we document our best-guess data compilation of published ice core records and recent measurements on firn air and atmospheric samples covering the time window from the penultimate glacial maximum (approx. 156 kyr BP) to 2016 CE. A smoothing spline method is applied to translate the discrete and irregularly spaced data points into continuous time series. These splines are assumed to represent the evolution of the atmospheric mixing ratios for the three GHGs. Global-mean radiative forcing for each GHG is computed using well-established, simple formulations. Newest published age scales are used for the ice core data. While CO2 is representing an integrated global signal, we compile only a southern hemisphere record of CH4 and identify how much larger a northern hemisphere or global CH4 record might have been due to its interhemispheric gradient. Data resolution and uncertainties are considered in the spline procedure and typical cutoff periods, defining the degree of smoothing, range from 5000 years for the less resolved older parts of the records to 4 years for the densely-sampled recent years. The data sets describe seamlessly the GHG evolution on orbital and millennial time scales for glacial and glacial-interglacial variations and on centennial and decadal time scales for anthropogenic times.",https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.871273,2017-07-20,https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.871273,PANGAEA

This unique long-term archive is the result of an exceptionally low net accumulation driven by wind erosion and rapid annual layer thinning. However, the full exploitation of the CG time series has been hampered by considerable dating uncertainties and the seasonal summer bias in snow preservation. Using a new core drilled in 2013 we extend annual layer counting, for the first time at CG, over the last 1000 years and add additional constraints to the resulting age scale from radiocarbon dating. Based on this improved age scale, and using a multi-core approach with a neighboring ice core, we explore the time series of stable water isotopes and the mineral dust proxies Ca2+ and insoluble particles. Also in our latest ice core we face the already known limitation to the quantitative use of the stable isotope variability based on a high and potentially non-stationary isotope/temperature sensitivity at CG. Decadal trends in Ca2+ reveal substantial agreement with instrumental temperature and are explored here as a potential site-specific supplement to the isotope-based temperature reconstruction. The observed coupling between temperature and Ca2+-trends likely results from snow preservation effects and the advection of dust-rich air masses coinciding with warm temperatures.We find that if calibrated against instrumental data, the Ca2+-based temperature reconstruction is in robust agreement with the latest proxy-based summer temperature reconstruction, including a ""Little Ice Age"" cold period as well as a medieval climate anomaly. Part of the medieval climate period around 1100-1200 AD clearly stands out through an increased occurrence of dust events, potentially resulting from a relative increase in meridional flow and/or dry conditions over the Mediterranean.",https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.883521,2018-01-10,https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.883521,PANGAEA

To study the consequences of newly established species interactions, one available source of data could be observational surveys from biodiversity monitoring. However, approaches using observational data would need to account for niche differences between species and for imperfect detection of individuals. To estimate population sizes of interacting species, we extended N-mixture models that were developed to estimate true population sizes in single species. Simulations revealed that our model is able to disentangle direct effects of dominant on subordinate species from indirect effects of dominant species on detection probability of subordinate species. For illustration, we applied our model to data from a Swiss amphibian monitoring program and showed that sizes of expanding water frog populations were negatively related to population sizes of endangered yellow-bellied toads and common midwife toads and partly of natterjack toads. Unlike other studies that analyzed presence and absence of species, our model suggests that the spread of water frogs in Central Europe is one of the reasons for the decline of endangered toad species. Thus, studying population impacts of dominant species on population sizes of endangered species using data from biodiversity monitoring programs should help to inform conservation policy and to decide whether competing species should be subject to population management.",10.5061/dryad.7gt4m.,2015-10-20,http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7gt4m,DRYAD

A thorough crystallographic analysis of [Fe(L5)3](ClO4)2 (I), [Ni(L5)3](ClO4)2 (II), [Ni(L5)3](BF4)2∙H2O (III), [Zn(L5)3](ClO4)2 (IV), [Ni(L5)3](BF4)2∙1.75CH3CN (V), and [Zn(L5)3](BF4)2∙1.5CH3CN (VI) shows the selective formation of pure facial [M(L5)3]2+ cations in the solvated crystals of the tetrafluoroborate salts and alternative meridional isomers in the perchlorate salts. Except for a slightly larger intra-strand interannular twist between the aromatic heterocycles in L5, the metric parameters measured in [Zn(L5)3]2+ are comparable to those reported for [Zn(L2)3]2+, where L2 is the related unconstrained ligand. This similitude is reinforced by comparable ligand-field strengths (∆oct) and nephelauxetic effects (as measured by the Racah parameters B and C) extracted from the electronic absorption spectra recorded for [Ni(L5)3]2+ and [Ni(L2)3]2+. In this context, the strictly high-spin behavior observed for [Fe(L5)3]2+ within the 5-300 K range contrasts with the close to room-temperature spin-crossover behavior of [Fe(L2)3]2+ (T1/2 = 349(5) K in acetonitrile). This can be unambiguously assigned to an intraligand arm wrestling match operating in bound L5, which prevents the contraction of the coordination sphere required for accommodating low-spin FeII. Since the analogous 3-methyl-pyridine ring in [Fe(L3)3]2+ derivatives are sometimes compatible with spin-crossover properties, the consequences of repulsive intra-strand methyl-methyl interactions are found to be amplified in [Fe(L5)3]2+ because of the much lower basicity of the 3-methyl-pyrazine ring and the resulting weaker thermodynamic compensation. The decrease of the stability constants by five orders of magnitude observed in going from [M(L2)3]2+ to [M(L5)3]2+ (M = NiII and ZnII) is diagnostic for the operation of this effect, which had been not foreseen by the authors.",ORCID iD: 0000-0001-7064-8548,2020-06-02,https://zenodo.org/record/3764730#.XrkaGMBS9aR,Zenodo

169424,5483B5B4-6EE4-4B56-8D0D-7EAB34D3655F,"Crack propagation speeds in weak snowpack layers from three events: PST, whumpf and slab avalanche","DescriptionFor the release of a slab avalanche, crack propagation within a weak snowpack layer below a cohesive snow slab is required. As crack speed measurements can give insight into the underlying processes, we analysed three crack propagation events that occurred in similar snowpacks and covered all scales relevant for avalanche release. For the largest scale, up to 400 m, we estimated crack speed from an avalanche movie, for scales between 5 and 25 meters, we used accelerometers placed on the snow surface, and for scales below 5 meters, we performed a Propagation Saw Test. The mean crack speeds ranged from 36 ± 6 to 49 ± 5 m s^{-1}, and did not exhibit scale dependence. Using the Discrete Element Method and the Material Point Method, we reproduced the measured crack speeds reasonably well, in particular the terminal crack speed observed at smaller scales. This dataset includes raw data as well as crack speed estimates from the three crack propagation events. Where possible, we reproduced these field experiments with numerical models based on Discrete Element Method (DEM, Bobillier and others, 2020 and 2021) and Material Point Method (MPM. Gaume and others, 2018 and Trottet and others, 2021). The input parameters of the models were estimated from the corresponding snow profiles conducted at each test site.The raw data include:    Propagation Saw Test movie with mechanical fields derived from Digital image Correlation analysis of the recording    Acceleration data recorded with wireless time synchronized accelerometers placed on the snow surface during crack propagation in a whumpf. *Video of an artificially triggered avalanche with widespread crack propagation. The video was used to georeference surface cracks in order to estimate crack propagation time and distance, providing crack propagation speed estimates.    Snow profile recorded at each test siteExperimental crack speed estimates include:    Crack speed evolution within the first meters derived from the Propagation Saw Test.    Crack speeds estimated from the time delay of the collapse, observed between different accelerometers during crack propagation of a whumpf.    Crack speed estimates from video analysis of the artificially triggered avalanche.Reproduced crack speeds using the DEM an MPM model:    Modelled Propagation Saw Test using MPM (2D and 3D system) and DEM.

You can find the instructions in the README.pdf file.If you are interested in building on top of our research results, you can find the latest version of Prusti in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev.AbstractRust's type system ensures memory safety: well-typed Rust programs are guaranteed to not exhibit problems such as dangling pointers, data races, and unexpected side effects through aliased references. Ensuring correctness properties beyond memory safety, for instance, the guaranteed absence of assertion failures or more-general functional correctness, requires static program verification. For traditional system programming languages, formal verification is notoriously difficult and requires complex specifications and logics to reason about pointers, aliasing, and side effects on mutable state. This complexity is a major obstacle to the more-widespread verification of system software.In this paper, we present a novel verification technique that leverages Rust's type system to greatly simplify the specification and verification of system software written in Rust. We analyse information from the Rust compiler and synthesise a corresponding core proof for the program in a flavour of separation logic tailored to automation. To verify correctness properties beyond memory safety, users can annotate Rust programs with specifications at the abstraction level of Rust expressions; our technique weaves them into the core proof to verify modularly whether these specifications hold. Crucially, our proofs are constructed and checked automatically without exposing the underlying formal logic, allowing users to work exclusively at the level of abstraction of the programming language. As such, our work enables a new kind of verification tool, with the potential to impact a wide audience and allow the Rust community to benefit from state-of-the-art verification techniques. We have implemented our techniques for a subset of Rust; our evaluation on several thousand functions from widely-used Rust crates demonstrates its effectiveness.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3363914,2019-08-15,https://zenodo.org/record/3363914,Zenodo

184669,71D640ED-A9E5-496D-8390-46BE9A619C78,pH taxis in African trypanosomes,"The collective movement of African trypanosomes on semi-solid surfaces, known as social motility, is presumed to be due to migration factors and repellents released by the parasites. Here we show that procyclic (insect midgut) forms acidify their environment as a consequence of glucose metabolism, generating pH gradients by diffusion. Early and late procyclic forms exhibit self-organising properties on agarose plates. While early procyclic forms are repelled by acid and migrate outwards, late procyclic forms remain at the inoculation site. Furthermore, trypanosomes respond to exogenously formed pH gradients, with both early and late procyclic forms being attracted to alkali. pH taxis is mediated by multiple cyclic AMP effectors: deletion of one copy of adenylate cyclase ACP5, or both copies of the cyclic AMP response protein CARP3, abrogates the response to acid, while deletion of phosphodiesterase PDEB1 completely abolishes pH taxis. The ability to sense pH is biologically relevant as trypanosomes experience large changes as they migrate through their tsetse host. Supporting this, a CARP3 null mutant is severely compromised in its ability to establish infections in flies. Based on these findings, we propose that the expanded family of adenylate cyclases in trypanosomes might govern other chemotactic responses in their two hosts.",PXD030766,2022-02-17,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD030766,ProteomeXchange

Here we show that procyclic (insect midgut) forms acidify their environment as a consequence of glucose metabolism, generating pH gradients by diffusion. Early and late procyclic forms exhibit self-organising propertieson surfaces. Both forms are attracted to alkali, but while early procyclic forms are repelled by acid and migrate outwards, late procyclic forms remain at the inoculation site. pH taxis relieson cyclic AMP signalling. Acid sensing requires a flagellar adenylate cyclase, ACP5, and a cyclic AMP response protein, CARP3, that interacts with ACP5. Deletion of the flagellar phosphodiesterase PDEB1 abolishes pH taxis completely. Trypanosomes can also respond to exogenously formed gradients. pH sensing is likely to be biologically relevant as trypanosomes experience large differences in pH as they progress through their tsetse fly host. In addition, self-generated gradients may help reinforce directionality. Moreover, since trypanosomes encode a large family of adenylate cyclases, these may govern other chemotactic responses and tissue tropisms in both the mammal and the fly.",PRJEB41935,2021-07-24,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB41935?show=reads,European Nucleotide Archive
184669,82FF37B9-8B0A-495F-9E01-24FCB5EFC15C,An Alba-domain protein required for proteome remodeling during differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei,"arasites. Over the past decade, it has been shown that Alba-domain proteins contribute to developmental regulation in protozoan parasites. Trypanosoma brucei, responsible for human sleeping sickness, progresses through distinct life cycle stages as it cycles between its mammalian and tsetse fly host. T. brucei has 4 Alba-domain proteins that have been shown to interact with each other and with proteins of the translation machinery. Here we describe deletion mutants of two Alba-domain proteins, Alba3 and Alba4, and the requirements for them in bloodstream forms and during the transition to procyclic forms. We show that deletion of Alba3 or Alba4 does not have an effect on parasite’s survival as bloodstream forms and that Alba3 and Alba4 are functionally redundant in bloodstream forms. In contrast, only Alba3 can support successful differentiation from the stumpy to the procyclic form. Comparative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of the Alba3 deletion mutant and wild-type parasites during differentiation, together with polysome profile analysis shows that differentiation regulation by Alba3 is achieved by extensive remodeling of the proteome. In summary, our studies show that Alba3 plays an important role in remodeling the proteome at the level of translation during differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic forms.",PRJEB38690,2020-12-16,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB38690?show=reads,European Nucleotide Archive

160812,934A0213-AA45-4B00-BBC3-6EE22F831128,Data from: Population size changes and selection drive patterns of parallel evolution in a host-virus system,"Predicting the repeatability of evolution remains elusive. Theory and empirical studies suggest that strong selection and large population sizes increase the probability for parallel evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels. However, selection and population sizes are not constant, but rather change continuously and directly affect each other even on short time scales. Here, we examine the degree of parallel evolution shaped through eco-evolutionary dynamics in an algal host population coevolving with a virus. We find high degrees of parallelism at the level of population size changes (ecology) and at the phenotypic level between replicated populations. At the genomic level, we find evidence for parallelism, as the same large genomic region was duplicated in all replicated populations, but also substantial novel sequence divergence between replicates. These patterns of genome evolution can be explained by considering population size changes as an important driver of rapid evolution.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4gf1qb7,2018-06-18,https://datadryad.org,Dryad

Urbanisation alters species richness and composition, but studies of urbanisation effects on ecological functions have often quantified variation in functional traits and changes in functional diversity rather than measuring directly how ecological functions vary between rural and urban assemblages.2.    Consuming dead animal matter and recycling its nutrients stabilizes and structures food webs and therefore represents a key component of ecosystem functioning. Introduction of free-ranging domestic pet animals adds additional scavenger species to urban habitats, and increased predictability of carcass resources produced by human activities characterizes urban habitats.3.    Here, we investigate the effect of urbanisation on the composition of diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages and on the ecological function of carcass removal by using a carcass placement experiment in Swiss urban and adjacent rural habitats.4.    While diurnal and nocturnal scavenger assemblages changed considerably from rural to urban areas by comprising particularly more domestic cats in the latter, carrion consumption rate did not differ between the two habitats. Predictability of carcass occurrence increased carrion consumption rate in both, urban and rural habitats but mainly native scavengers and not introduced domestic pets responded to the repeated placements.5.    These results suggest that urbanisation shapes scavenger assemblage compositions without affecting their ecological function. The mechanism is likely due to a behavioural change of native scavengers in response to the occurrence of domestic pets resulting in functional plasticity of urban scavenger assemblages. The functional plasticity might be facilitated by the increased carcass predictability and additional anthropogenic food resources in urban habitats exploited by nutritionally flexible native scavenger species.",https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.q83bk3jdb,2019-10-22,https://datadryad.org/stash,Dryad

Cancer stem cells are thought to be associated with PCa relapse. Here, we show that BAZ2A is required for PCa cells with a cancer stem-like state. BAZ2A genomic occupancy in PCa cells coincides with H3K14ac-enriched chromatin regions. This association is mediated by BAZ2A-bromodomain (BAZ2A-BRD) that specifically binds H3K14ac. BAZ2A associates with inactive enhancers marked by H3K14ac and repressing transcription of genes frequently silenced in aggressive and poorly differentiated PCa. BAZ2A-mediated repression is also linked to EP300 that acetylates H3K14ac. BAZ2A-BRD mutations or treatment with inhibitors abrogating BAZ2A-BRD/H3K14ac interaction impair PCa stem cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation of BAZ2A-BRD impairs Pten-loss oncogenic transformation of prostate organoids. Our findings indicate a role of BAZ2A-BRD in PCa stem cell features and suggest potential epigenetic-reader therapeutic strategies to target BAZ2A in aggressive PCa.",10.15252/embr.202153014,2021-08-17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131268,Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be derived at this stage and represent the immortalization of the pluripotent state by acquiring the capacity for infinite self-renewal. The precise molecular changes accompanying the arrest of the normal developmental program during ICM/ESC transition remain to be fully elucidated. Compared to ESCs, naïve pluripotency of ICM has been associated with global DNA hypomethylation and a generally low repressive epigenetic state that might serve for a greater flexibility to undergo rapid and transient phenotypic and developmental changes. Here we show that Pramel7 (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma-like 7), a protein exclusively expressed in ICM but present only at low levels in ESCs, functions as a substrate recognition component of the proteasome system by targeting degradation of UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains, 1), a key factor for the maintenance of DNA methylation. Enhancing the expression of Pramel7 in ESCs reduces UHRF1 levels, induces expression of ICM specific genes and causes global DNA hypomethylation. Expression of Pramel7 locks ESCs in pluripotency and destabilizes terminal differentiation by maintaining elevated expression of pluripotency genes through inhibition of de novo DNA methylation. Together, these findings reveal an as-yet-unappreciated dynamic nature of DNA methylation through the control of the proteasome pathway. Moreover, they offer important insights for the establishment of the unique epigenotype of naïve pluripotency that might help in establishing more physiological ESC culture conditions to in vitro reproduce the in vivo ground state pluripotency.",10.1038/ncb3554,2017-07-01,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB12665,ENA

How genome compartmentalization is regulated remains elusive. Here, comparison of mouse ground-state embryonic stem cells (ESCs) characterized by open and active chromatin, and advanced serum ESCs with a more closed and repressed genome, reveals distinct regulation of their genome organization due to differential dependency on BAZ2A/TIP5, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC. On ESC chromatin, BAZ2A interacts with SNF2H, DNA topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and cohesin. BAZ2A associates with chromatin subdomains within the active A compartment, which intersect through long-range contacts. We found that ground-state chromatin selectively requires BAZ2A to limit the invasion of active domains into repressive compartments. BAZ2A depletion increases chromatin accessibility at B compartments. Furthermore, BAZ2A regulates H3K27me3 genome occupancy in a TOP2A-dependent manner. Finally, ground-state ESCs require BAZ2A for growth, differentiation, and correct expression of developmental genes. Our results uncover the propensity of open chromatin domains to invade repressive domains, which is counteracted by chromatin remodeling to establish genome partitioning and preserve cell identity.",https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.2020105606,2020-10-20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112222,NCBI’s GEO

Its clinical and molecular heterogeneities and the lack of in vitro models outline the complexity of PCa in the clinical and research settings. We established an in vitro mouse PCa model based on organoid technology that takes into account the cell of origin and the order of events. Primary PCa with deletion of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN ( PTEN -del) can be modeled through Pten- down-regulation in mouse organoids. We used this system to elucidate the contribution of TIP5 in PCa initiation, a chromatin regulator that is implicated in aggressive PCa. High TIP5 expression correlates with primary PTEN -del PCa and this combination strongly associates with reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival. TIP5 is critical for the initiation of PCa of luminal origin mediated by Pten -loss whereas it is dispensable once Pten -loss mediated transformation is established. Cross-species analyses revealed a PTEN gene signature that identified a group of aggressive primary PCas characterized by PTEN -del, high-TIP5 expression, and a TIP5-regulated gene expression profile. The results highlight the modeling of PCa with organoids as a powerful tool to elucidate the role of genetic alterations found in recent studies in their time orders and cells of origin, thereby providing further optimization for tumor stratification to improve the clinical management of PCa.",10.1073/pnas.1911673117,2020-02-03,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131845,NCBI GEO

(2019). Briefly, high-quality DNA of 20 trees per population was used to produce equimolar DNA pools for all 24 populations for pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq; Rellstab, Zoller, Tedder, Gugerli, & Fischer, 2013; Schlötterer, Tobler, Kofler, & Nolte, 2014), which has shown to yield accurate estimates of allele frequencies in this sequencing approach (Rellstab et al., 2019). We generated barcoded libraries (average insert size of 550 bp) using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA) and subsequently performed probe hybridisation using the MYcroarray myBaits Custom Capture Kit. The 24 hybridised libraries were then sequenced on four lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (paired-end reads of 150 bp) at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ, Zurich, Switzerland) and Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland; Table S4).Following Rellstab et al. (2019), we trimmed and filtered raw reads with TRIMMOMATIC 0.35 (Bolger, Lohse, & Usadel, 2014) using a quality threshold of 20 on both forward and reverse reads. We then mapped the remaining reads back to those transcripts of the reference transcriptome that contained probe bases using BOWTIE 2.3.0 (Langmead, Trapnell, Pop, & Salzberg, 2009), and performed variant (i.e. SNP) and invariant site calling using GATK 3.8 (McKenna et al., 2010) with ploidy set to 40 (i.e. number of chromosomes sequenced per pool of 20 diploid individuals), a coverage ≥40×, and a mapping quality/depth ratio ≥0.25. To get rid of putatively paralogous genes, variant and invariant calling was carried out only for the 4,950 single-copy contigs as determined in Rellstab et al. (2019). These authors used HDplot (McKinney, Waples, Seeb, & Seeb, 2017) to exclude putatively paralogous contigs based on excess heterozygosity and deviation from usual allele balance (read ratio). To conduct population genetic analyses, we assembled a SNP set based on two additional filters to exclude weakly supported SNPs: excluding SNPs with (i) a minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤2.5% across populations (i.e. one chromosome in a pool) and (ii) missing data in at least one population.",10.5061/dryad.9kd51 c5dr,2020-08-28,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.9kd51c5dr,Dryad

Competition among relatives over limited resources, on the other hand, can induce individuals to alter their patterns of association. Population density might further affect the costs and benefits of associating with relatives by altering resource competition or by changing the structure of social groups; preventing easy association with relatives. Consequently, the overlap between genetic and social structure is expected to decrease with increasing population size, as well as during times of increased breeding activity. Here, we use multi-layer network techniques to quantify the similarity between long-term, high resolution genetic, and behavioral data from a large population of free-ranging house mice (Mus musculus domesticus), studied over 10 years. We infer how the benefit of associating with genetically similar individuals might fluctuate in relation to breeding behavior and environmental conditions. We found a clear seasonal effect, with decreased overlap between social and genetic structure during summer months, characterized by high temperatures and high breeding activity. Though the effect of overall population size was relatively weak, we found a clear decrease in the overlap between genetic similarity and social associations within larger groups. As well as longer-term within-group changes, these results reveal population-wide short-term shifts in how individuals associate with relatives. Our study suggests that resource competition modifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of interacting with relatives.",doi,2020-06-18,https://academic.oup.com/cz,doi

We found that the microprocessor components DGCR8 and DROSHA are crucial for axonal radial sorting and to establish correct SC numbers upon myelination. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the microprocessor is essential to prevent aberrant accumulation and de novo expression of injury-response genes. Those genes are predicted targets of stage-specifically enriched miRNAs. In agreement, DGCR8 and DICER are required for proper maintenance of the myelinated SC state. We conclude that the miRNA pathway is crucial for preventing inappropriate activity of injury response genes in developing and adult SCs.",GSE109075,2018-10-08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109075,GEO

Myelin allows the rapid propagation of action potentials along the axons, while also supporting their mantainance metabolically. Fatty acids are basic building blocks for both glyco- and phospholipids, key constituents of cell membranes. Moreover, fatty acids can modify proteins via palmitoylation and activate transcriptional networks, e.g. through the PPARs transcription factors. Due to the high demand of membrane oligodendrocytes face to produce myelin, we hypothesized that they strongly rely upon fatty acid synthesis rather than mostly on their intake from the dietary pool. We tested this hypothesis by deleting the enzyme Fatty Acid Synthase specifically from neonatal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, in vivo in C57Bl/6 olig2Cre FASN floxed mice. We addressed the consequences of this depletion on oligodendrocytes differentation and myelination potential in the central nervous system. In particular, we analyzed by RNA-seq how lack of FASN affected the transcriptome of optic nerves dissected from P14 mutant (olig2Cre FASN lox/lox) versus control (FASN lox/lox) mice.",GSE112725,2019-05-03,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112725,GEO

Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.",10.5281/zenodo.4529161,2020-07-09,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4529161,Zenodo

Based on the well documented role of inflammation in type 2 diabetes, the aim was to investigate the role of inflammation in GDM. We established a mouse model for GDM on the basis of its two major risk factors, obesity and aging. In these GDM mice, we observed increased Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression in the uterus and the placenta along with elevated circulating IL-1β concentrations compared to normoglycemic pregnant mice. Treatment with an anti-IL-1β antibody improved glucose-tolerance of GDM mice without apparent deleterious effects for the fetus. Finally, IL-1β antagonism showed a tendency for reduced plasma corticosterone concentrations, possibly explaining the metabolic improvement. We conclude that IL-1β is a causal driver of impaired glucose tolerance in GDM.",10.5281/zenodo.5509903,2020-03-20,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5509903,Zenodo

Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models.

This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

The generation of ROS can be both the cause and a consequence of ER stress pathways, and an increasing number of human diseases are characterized by tissue atrophy in response to ER stress and oxidative injury. For the assessment of modulators of ER luminal ROS generation and for mechanistic studies, methods to monitor changes in ER reduction-oxidation (redox) states in a time-resolved and organelle-specific manner are needed. This has been greatly facilitated by the development of genetically encoded fluorescent probes, which can be targeted to different subcellular locations by specific amino acid extensions. One of these probes is the yellow fluorescent protein-based redox biosensor, HyPer. Here, we provide a protocol for the time-resolved monitoring of the oxidizing milieu in the ER of adherent mammalian cells using the ratiometric sensor, HyPerER, which is specifically targeted to the ER lumen.",10.5281/zenodo.5082260,2021-07-05,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5082260,Zenodo

Pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. This study investigated whether alternative 7-oxo bile acid substrates of 11β-HSD1 or the ratios to their 7-hydroxy products can serve as biomarkers for decreased enzymatic activity.Bile acid profiles were measured by ultra-HPLC tandem-MS in plasma and liver tissue samples of four different mouse models with decreased 11β-HSD1 activity: global (11KO) and liver-specific 11β-HSD1 knockout mice (11LKO), mice lacking hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6pdKO) that provides cofactor NADPH for 11β-HSD1 and mice treated with the pharmacological inhibitor carbenoxolone. Additionally, 11β-HSD1 expression and activity were assessed in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice.The enzyme product to substrate ratios were more reliable markers of 11β-HSD1 activity than absolute levels due to large inter-individual variations in bile acid concentrations. The ratio of the 7β-hydroxylated ursodeoxycholyltaurine (UDC-Tau) to 7-oxolithocholyltaurine (7oxoLC-Tau) was diminished in plasma and liver tissue of all four mouse models and decreased in H6pdKO- and carbenoxolone-treated mice with moderately reduced 11β-HSD1 activity. The persistence of 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in the face of H6PD loss indicates the existence of an alternative NADPH source in the endoplasmic reticulum.The plasma UDC-Tau/7oxo-LC-Tau ratio detects decreased 11β-HSD1 oxoreduction activity in different mouse models. This ratio may be a useful biomarker of decreased 11β-HSD1 activity in pathophysiological situations or upon pharmacological inhibition.This article is part of a themed issue on Oxysterols, Lifelong Health and Therapeutics.

Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.",10.5281/zenodo.4528982,2020-07-09,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4528982,Zenodo

Additionally, bile acids are bioactive molecules acting through receptors and modulating various physiological processes. Impaired bile acid homeostasis is associated with several diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Individual bile acids may serve as disease and drug toxicity biomarkers, with a great demand for improved bile acid quantification methods. We developed, optimized, and validated an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of 36 bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue samples. The simultaneous quantification of important free and taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids of human and rodent species has been achieved using a simple workflow. The method was applied to a mouse model of statin-induced myotoxicity to assess a possible role of bile acids. Treatment of mice for three weeks with 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/d simvastatin, causing adverse skeletal muscle effects, did not alter plasma and liver tissue bile acid profiles, indicating that bile acids are not involved in statin-induced myotoxicity. In conclusion, the established LC-MS/MS method enables uncomplicated sample preparation and quantification of key bile acids in serum, plasma, and liver tissue of human and rodent species to facilitate future studies of disease mechanisms and drug-induced liver injury.",10.5281/zenodo.4529044,2020-07-09,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4529044,Zenodo

Despite a wide range of production contexts, screams are characterised by an acoustic structure that appears to serve in altering the behaviour of targeted receivers during agonistic encounters. In chimpanzees, this can be achieved by callers producing acoustic variants that correlate with their identity, social role, relationship with the targeted recipient, the composition of the audience and the nature of the event. Although vervet monkeys (<em>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</em>) have been studied for decades, not much is known about their agonistic screams. Here, we examined agonistic screams produced by wild vervet monkeys to investigate the degree to which caller identity, social role and conflict severity affected call structure. We found that screams were both individually distinctive and dependent of the agonistic events. In particular, victim screams were longer and higher-pitched than aggressor screams, while screams produced in severe conflicts (chases, physical contact) had higher entropy than those in mild conflicts. We discuss these findings in terms of their evolutionary significance and suggest that acoustic variation might serve to reduce the aggression level of opponents, while simultaneously attracting potential helpers.",https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5413975.v1,,https://figshare.com/articles/Correlates_of_social_role_and_conflict_severity_in_wild_vervet_monkey_agonistic_screams/5413975,figshare

However, tool use and elaborate object manipulations are rare in natural conditions, suggesting that social learning evolved in other contexts where fitness consequences are higher, such as discriminating palatable from noxious foods, recognising predators or understanding social hierarchies. We focussed on one such context by investigating whether bonobos socially learned others’ arbitrary food preferences through mere observation. To this end, we trained two demonstrators to prefer or avoid distinctly coloured food items, treated with either a sweet or bitter agent. Demonstrators then displayed their newly acquired preferences in front of naïve subjects. In subsequent choice tests, subjects generally matched their choices to the demonstrators’ preferred food colours, despite having already tasted the equally palatable colour alternative. Both age and exposure to demonstrator preference had a significant positive effect on the proportion of matched choices. Moreover, in a context where errors can be costly, social learning was instant insofar as six of seven subjects used socially learned information to influence their very first food choice. We discuss these findings in light of the current debate on the evolution of social learning in animals.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2019.103912,,https://mendeley.figshare.com/articles/Social_learning_of_arbitrary_food_preferences_in_bonobos/9119837/1,figshare

This may be due to limits in animal physical cognition, such as an inability to compare the efficiency of a novel behavioural innovation with an already existing tradition. We investigated this possibility with a study on a natural tool innovation in wild chimpanzees: moss-sponging, which recently emerged in some individuals to extract mineral-rich liquids at a natural clay-pit. The behaviour probably arose as a variant of leaf-sponging, a tool technique seen in all studied chimpanzee communities. We found that moss-sponges not only absorbed more liquid but were manufactured and used more rapidly than leaf-sponges, suggesting a functional improvement. To investigate whether chimpanzees understood the advantage of moss- over leaf-sponges, we experimentally offered small amounts of rainwater in an artificial cavity of a portable log, together with both sponge materials, moss and leaves. We found that established moss-spongers (having used both leaves and moss to make sponges) preferred moss to prepare a sponge to access the rainwater, whereas leaf-spongers (never observed using moss) preferred leaves. Survey data finally demonstrated that moss was common in forest areas near clay-pits but nearly absent in other forest areas, suggesting that natural moss-sponging was at least partly constrained by ecology. Together, these results suggest that chimpanzees perceive functional improvements in tool quality, a crucial prerequisite for cumulative culture.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.1715,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rspb.2018.1715,supplementary

To explore how listeners process these sequences, we recorded alarm call sequences of six free-ranging groups exposed to terrestrial and aerial predator models, placed on the ground or in the canopy, and used multimodel inference to assess the information encoded in the sequences. We then carried out playback experiments to identify the features used by listeners to react to the available information. Results indicated that information about predator type and location were encoded by the proportion of B-call pairs relative to all call pairs of the sequence (i.e., proportion of BB-grams). The results suggest that the meaning of the sequence is not conveyed in a categorical but probabilistic manner. We discuss the implications of these findings for current theories of animal communication and language evolution.",10.1126/sciadv.aav3991,,https://figshare.com/projects/Probabilistic_meaning_in_titi_monkeys_alarm:call_sequences/30488,figshare
166458,8ECBED13-C131-4A4A-8D9F-DE834C62BBA3,Behavioural patterns of vocal greeting production in four primate species,"Social animals have evolved a range of signals to avoid aggressive and facilitate affiliative interactions. Vocal behaviour is especially important in this respect with many species, including various primates, producing acoustically distinct ‘greeting calls’ when two individuals approach each other. While the ultimate function of greeting calls has been explored in several species, little effort has been made to understand the mechanisms of this behaviour across species. The aim of this study was to explore how differences in individual features (individual dominance rank), dyadic relationships (dominance distance and social bond strength) and audience composition (presence of high-ranking or strongly bonded individuals in proximity), related to vocal greeting production during approaches between two individuals in the philopatric sex of four primate species: female olive baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>), male chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), female sooty mangabeys (<i>Cercocebus atys</i>) and female vervet monkeys (<i>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</i>). We found that female vervet monkeys did not produce greeting calls, while in the other three species, low-ranking individuals were more likely to call than high-ranking ones. The effects of dyadic dominance relationships differed in species-specific ways, with calling being positively associated with the rank distance between two individuals in baboons and chimpanzees, but negatively in mangabeys. In none of the tested species did we find strong evidence for an effect of dyadic affiliative relationships or audience on call production. These results likely reflect deeper evolutionary layers of species-specific peculiarities in social style.

Previous work has suggested that wild chimpanzees are especially prone to engaging with tools during extended periods of low food availability and after long travel, supporting the hypothesis that cultural innovation is facilitated by necessity revealing opportunities. Here, we tested this hypothesis with a field experiment that directly compared subjects' immediate variation in measures of current energy balance with their interest in a novel foraging problem, liquid honey enclosed in an apparatus accessible by tool use. We found that the previous distance traveled directly predicted subjects' manipulations of both the apparatus and the tool, whereas previous feeding time was negatively correlated to manipulation time. We conclude that ""necessity"" augments chimpanzees' likelihood of engaging with ecological ""opportunities,"" suggesting that both factors are scaffolding foraging innovation in this and potentially other species.</p>",https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/30/4/1136/5486737,2019-01-26,https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:120755,Repository

166458,DA241876-7D8E-454B-B8B1-71DF0A237C86,The development of communication in alarm contexts in wild chimpanzees,"Animals have evolved a range of communicative behaviours in the presence of danger. Although the mechanisms and functions of some of these behaviours have been relatively well researched, comparatively little is known about their ontogeny, including how animals learn to inform social partners about impending danger. In adult chimpanzees, behaviours in response to dangers involve several channels, particularly alarm calls and simultaneous gaze alternations with nearby recipients. Gaze alternations may allow inexperienced individuals to learn from more experienced ones by assessing their reactions to unfamiliar objects or events, but they may also provide the basis for more advanced social referencing. Here, we were interested in the development of these two common behaviours, alarm calling and gaze alternations, in wild chimpanzees (<em class=""EmphasisTypeItalic"">Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii</em>) confronted with a threat. Using a cross-sectional design, we investigated those in 8 infant and 8 juveniles by experimentally exposing them to an unfamiliar but potentially dangerous object, a large, remotely controlled, moving spider model. For alarm calling, we found a positive relation with age, starting at around 28 months, although alarm calls were not consistently emitted until after 80 months. For gaze alternations, we found no age effect, with some of the youngest infants already showing the behaviour. Although its function remains unclear in infant and juvenile chimpanzees, gaze alternations emerge early in chimpanzee development. Alarm calling may require more advanced developmental stages, such as greater perceptual abilities, categorical capacities or more sophisticated social cognition, i.e. an understanding that danger is a collective experience that requires communication.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-019-2716-6,2019-01-26,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/18057/Dezecache_2019_BES_alarmcontexts_CC.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,PURE St Andrews

Children showed better word learning, but not better action imitation, from a competent than from an incompetent informant.

The vigorous immune response induced by a virulent pathogen generally leads to more efficacious mucosal immunity than exposure to an avirulent strain. Whether the associated inflammation stimulus is necessary or redundant for the induction of functional adaptive immunity is unclear and has been difficult to address experimentally. Here we show that live bacterial virulence factor-driven superior functional immunogenicity can be uncoupled from concomitant inflammatory pathology. We used a novel quantitative infection model of auxotrophic Salmonella enterica mutants in germ-free animals to dissect the bacterial parameters contributing to immunogenicity. Although mucosal Salmonella virulence factor function in this model no longer caused marked innate inflammatory responses, it remained the main driver of protective mucosal immunity. Isogenic virulence factor-deficient, like chemically inactivated, bacteria were significantly impaired in their protective immunogenicity. Despite their known functions in Salmonella-induced innate immunity, innate pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways through MYD88 and TRIF, Caspase-1 and -11, NLRC4, and NOD1 and -2 were redundant in vivo for the robust live Salmonella-induced mucosal adaptive immunity. These findings reveal exquisite system redundancy between the inductive mechanisms of innate and adaptive mucosal immunity that allows robust pathogen recognition and may be exploitable for the vaccination in innate immunodeficient individuals.",PRJEB37168,2020-04-24,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB37168,ENA European Nucleotide Archive

By selectively disrupturing the outer membrane (OM), this peptidomimetic displayed a novel mechanism of action and opens new avenues for developing antibiotics that specifically target the OM of Gram-negative bacteria. Escherichia coli ATCC25922 cells were grown in LB medium with or without the peptidomimetic JB-95 (5 ?g/ml), prior to extraction of total membrane fractions by differential ultracentrifugation and further separation of the complex protein mixture on 1-D SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were cut into ten slices; after reduction and carbamidomethylation, the proteins were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated by RP-HPLC and analyzed with an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with a nanoelectrospray source. Three biological replicates were analyzed, respectively (the first expt. was analyzed on an Orbitrap XL). Mass spectra were searched against a protein sequence database containing 4104 E. coli K12 (strain MG1655; NC_000913.3) proteins and protein sequences of 256 common contaminants using MS-GF+ (MS-GFDB v9979) and the following parameters: Carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification on all Cysteines, and oxidation of Methionines was considered as optional modification. Spectra were searched for a match to fully-tryptic and semi-tryptic peptides and the automatic decoy search option was enabled. Search results were filtered and summarized using in-house tools. Requiring either three spectra or two distinct unambiguous peptides (class 1a and 3a; Qeli & Ahrens, PeptideClassifier, Nat Biotech 2010), 1740 proteins (at an estimated protein FDR less than 1%; estimated spectral FDR less than 0.1%) were identified in E.coli ATCC25922 under growth with and without exposure to the peptidomimetic JB-95. Significantly differentially regulated proteins were identified with DESeq2 (v1.4.5) applying a Benjamini-Hochberg q-value threshold 0.06 to correct for multiple testing.",10.6019/PXD002588,2015-12-07,"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002588 (PRIDE project URL)

Its complex genome, which also included a variable shufflon region, could not be denovo assembled with long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences’ technology, but required very longreads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Importantly, a repeat analysis, whose results we release forover 9600 prokaryotes, indicated that very complex bacterial genomes represent a general phenomenonbeyond Pseudomonas. Roughly 10% of 9331 complete bacterial and a handful of 293 complete archaealgenomes represented this ‘dark matter’ for de novo genome assembly of prokaryotes. Several of these ‘dark matter’ genome assemblies contained repeats far beyond the resolution of the sequencingtechnology employed and likely contain errors, other genomes were closed employing labor-intense steps like cosmid libraries, primer walking or optical mapping.Using very long sequencing reads in combination with assembly algorithms capable of resolving long, near identical repeats will bring most prokaryotic genomes within reach of fast and complete de novo genome assembly.",CP027477-CP027481,2018-04-12,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP027481.1

For our contribution, we re-analyzed proteomic data we had helped to analyze and deposit in public repositories before: data from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (now Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens) USDA 110 grown in rich (PSY) and minimal medium (PXD000487), and data on protein expression of B. japonicum in symbiosis with soybean root nodules (PRD000813), cowpea and siratro root nodules (PRD0766).During the symbiosis with legumes, Bradyrhizobium japonicum cells infect roots where they induce the formation of root nodules and differentiate into intracellular nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. We used differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq; data provided by K. Förstner) for the genome-wide detection of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) in B. japonicum USDA 110 cells grown free-living or as bacteroids in soybean root nodules.A newly developed TSS recognition procedure based on machine learning allowed us to map 15,923 TSSs: 14,360 in free-living bacteria, 4,329 in bacteroids and 2,766 in both living conditions. Using a proteogenomics approach (re-analysis of public protein datasets ), we provide evidence for the translation of 107 new transcripts including 14 with TSSs in annotated genes. In addition, we provide evidence for 178 shorter or longer proteins, 109 of them with TSS support (Data provided by U. Omasits, C.H. Ahrens, Additional file 7 (Table S5, S6)). Based on our TSS map and a new de novo promoter prediction algorithm, we identified promoter motifs mainly used in nodules (similar to RpoN-dependent promoters) or under both conditions (similar to RpoD-dependent promoters). The data is made available in a generic feature format (GFF) file along with an updated and extended genome annotation comprising promoters, TSSs and terminators (Additional files 5 and 6). The value of such a TSS and promoter map beyond the identification of novel transcripts and ORFs is illustrated by the experimental analysis of an antisense RNA, which is a by-product of transcriptional interference in a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 highly expressed in nodules.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE69059 (Download link, incl. metadata)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP058513 (Data available in the NCBI short read archive (SRA))",GSE69059,2016-04-18,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69059

The first measuring site was established in the Erlenbach stream, a small (first-order) catchment in the pre-alpine valley Alptal in central Switzerland. Continuous bedload transport measurements were started in 1986, using first piezoelectric sensors (1986 to 1999) and then geophone sensors (from 2002 onwards) underneath a steel plate and mounted flush with the streambed. In the meantime, the so-called Swiss plate geophone (SPG) system has been installed at more than 20 field sites, primarily in smaller and steeper streams in Switzerland, Austria, and Italy but also in a few larger rivers and in some other streams worldwide (Israel, USA, Japan). Sediment transport observations in Switzerland with the SPG system concern the following streams: Erlenbach near Brunni (Alptal valley), Albula at Tiefencastel, Navisence at Zinal, Avançon de Nant near Pont de Nant (see map). The data in this repository primarily refer to calibration measurements with the SPG system.

It is an open question, however, when actors actually create manifest conflicts about overlapping norms and rules and how - and with what consequences - such conflicts are handled. We therefore utilize the concept of “interface conflicts” (ICs) in which two or more actors express positional differences over the scope or prevalence of different international norms. Building on the findings of the DFG research group OSAIC, we introduce the Interface Conflicts 1.0 dataset, which assembles information on 78 ICs. The dataset provides information on the actors and norms at stake in ICs and focuses specifically on their subsequent handling. It distinguishes co-operative from non-cooperative conflict management and codes the institutional as well as distributional outcomes of all management efforts.",https://doi.org/10.7802/2241,2021-02-01,https://data.gesis.org/sharing/#!Detail/10.7802/2241,GESIS

Theory predicts that species persistence and speciation in sympatry with gene flow are facilitated if loci of large effect or physical linkage (or pleiotropy) underlie traits involved in reproductive isolation. Here we investigate the genetic architecture of a key trait involved in behavioural isolation, male nuptial coloration, by crossing two sister species pairs of Lake Victoria cichlids of the genus Pundamilia and mapping nuptial coloration in the F2 hybrids. One is a young sympatric species pair, representative of an axis of colour motif differentiation, red-dorsum vs blue, that is highly recurrent in closely related sympatric species. The other is a species pair representative of colour motifs, red-chest vs blue, that are common in allopatric but uncommon in sympatric closely related species. We find significant QTLs with moderate to large effects (some overlapping) for red and yellow in the sympatric red-dorsum x blue cross, whereas we find no significant QTLs in the non-sympatric red-chest x blue cross. These findings are consistent with theory predicting that large effect loci or linkage/pleiotropy underlying mating trait differentiation could facilitate speciation and species persistence with gene flow in sympatry.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbp1n,2020-03-25,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbp1n,Dryad

163338,34EA930B-4607-4FD6-8C1D-46C84C088A2A,Data from: The ecological and genomic basis of explosive adaptive radiation,"Rates of speciation vary tremendously among evolutionary lineages, with our understanding of what fuels the rapid succession of speciation events within young adaptive radiations remaining particularly incomplete. The cichlid fish family provides the most notable example of such variation among extant metazoans. It includes many slowly speciating lineages as well as the several exceptionally large and rapid adaptive radiations. By reconstructing a large phylogeny of all described cichlid species, we show that explosive speciation is solely concentrated in several large yet young lake species flocks. Across the family, speciation rate increases are associated with absence of top predators, and speciation rate decreases are associated with arid climate, but these factors are not nearly sufficient to explain explosive speciation in lake radiations, in particular the Lake Victoria adaptive radiation. Across lake radiations we observe a positive relationship between speciation rate and enrichment with large indel polymorphisms. Assembly of one hundred Victorian cichlid genomes comprising all extant ecological guilds and taxonomic genera reveals this radiation contains exceptional ‘genomic potential’ - hundreds of ancient haplotypes bearing indel polymorphisms, many of which are strongly associated with specific ecologies and are shared with ecologically similar species from other older lake radiations elsewhere in Africa. Network analysis reveals fundamentally non-treelike evolution through recombining old haplotypes, with origins of ecological guilds concentrated early in the Victoria radiation. Our results suggest that the combination of ecological opportunity, sexual selection and exceptional genomic potential is the key to understanding explosive adaptive radiation.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fn2z34tr0,2020-09-21,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fn2z34tr0,Dryad
163338,6027E107-E323-4C9D-B073-48533B88837A,Data from: Interspecific hybridization can generate functional novelty in cichlid fish,"The role of interspecific hybridization in evolution is still being debated. Interspecific hybridization has on the one hand been suggested to facilitate the evolution of ecological novelty and hence the invasion of new niches and adaptive radiation when ecological opportunity is present beyond the parental species niches. On the other hand, hybrids between two ecologically divergent species may perform less well than parental species in their respective niches because hybrids would be intermediate in performance in both niches. The evolutionary consequences of hybridization may hence be context-dependent, depending on whether additional ecological opportunities do or do not exist. Surprisingly, these complementary predictions may never have been tested in the same experiment in animals. To do so, we investigate if hybrids between ecologically distinct cichlid species perform less well than the parental types when feeding on food either parental species are adapted to, and if the same hybrids perform better compared to their parents when feeding on food none of the species are adapted to. We generated two first-generation experimental hybrid crosses between species of African cichlids. In feeding efficiency experiments we measure the performance of hybrids and parental species on food types representing both parental species niches and additional ‘novel’ niches, not utilized by part of the parental species but by other species in the African cichlid radiations. We found that hybrids can have higher feeding efficiencies on the ‘novel’ food types but typically have lower efficiencies on parental food types when compared to parental species. This suggests that hybridization can generate functional variation that can be of ecological relevance allowing the access to resources outside of either parental species niche. Hence, we provide support for the hypothesis of ecological context-dependency of the evolutionary impact of interspecific hybridization.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m25t886,2019-10-14,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m25t886,Dryad

Such hybridization might provide important fuel for adaptive radiation. Interspecific hybrids can have extreme trait values or novel trait combinations and such transgressive phenotypes may allow some hybrids to explore ecological niches neither of the parental species could tap into. Here, we investigate the potential of second-generation (F2) hybrids between two generalist cichlid species from Lake Malawi to exploit a resource neither parental species is specialised on: feeding by sifting sand. Some of the F2 hybrids phenotypically resembled fish of species that are specialised on sand sifting. We combined experimental behavioural and morphometric approaches to test whether the F2 hybrids are transgressive in both morphology and behaviour related to sand sifting. We then performed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using RADseq markers to investigate the genetic architecture of morphological and behavioural traits. We show that transgression is present in several morphological traits, that novel trait combinations occur, and we observe transgressive trait values in sand sifting behaviour in some of the F2 hybrids. Moreover, we find QTLs for morphology and for sand sifting behaviour, suggesting the existence of some loci with moderate to large effects. We demonstrate that hybridization has the potential to rapidly generate novel and ecologically relevant phenotypes that may be suited to a niche neither of the parental species occupies. Interspecific hybridization may thereby contribute to the rapid generation of ecological diversity in cichlid radiations.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mn7,2020-08-13,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.280gb5mn7,Dryad

In the adaptive radiation of Lake Victoria cichlid fishes, sister species with either blue or red-back male nuptial coloration have evolved repeatedly, often associated with shallower and deeper water, respectively. One such case are blue and red-backed Pundamilia species, for which we recently showed that a young species pair may have evolved through “hybrid parallel speciation”. Coalescent simulations suggested that the older species P. pundamilia (blue) and P. nyererei (red-back) admixed in the Mwanza Gulf and that new “nyererei-like” and “pundamilia-like” species evolved from the admixed population. Here, we use genome scans to study the genomic architecture of differentiation, and assess the influence of hybridization on the evolution of the younger species pair. For each of the two species pairs, we find over 300 genomic regions, widespread across the genome, which are highly differentiated. A subset of the most strongly differentiated regions of the older pair are also differentiated in the younger pair. These shared differentiated regions often show parallel allele frequency differences, consistent with the hypothesis that admixture-derived alleles were targeted by divergent selection in the hybrid population. However, two thirds of the genomic regions that are highly differentiated between the younger species are not highly differentiated between the older species, suggesting independent evolutionary responses to selection pressures. Our analyses reveal how divergent selection on admixture-derived genetic variation can facilitate new speciation events.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8p6m07g,2019-03-19,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.8p6m07g,Dryad

These samples were analysed by various geochemical means to assign them to a volcanic unit. In addition, the bulk rock magnetic properties of a subset of these samples were determined to aid interpretation of existing aeromagnetic data. The whole-rock major element and select trace element (Ba, Sr, Zr, Y, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, V, Sc) composition of the majority of these samples was determined by X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) at ETH Zürich using a PANalyticalTM Axios wavelength-dispersive instrument. Trace elements in a subset of these samples were further analysed by pressed-powder-pellet laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (PPP-LA-ICP-MS) using a GeoLas-Pro 193 nm ArF Excimer™ laser system in combination with an ELAN DRC-e™ quadrupole mass spectrometer at the University of Bern. Where necessary for unit assignment, igneous clinopyroxenes in another subset of samples were measured by Electron microprobe (EMP) on a JeolTM JXA-8200 EMP at the University of Bern. A set of volcanic glasses were also analysed by EMP on the same instrument. Bulk magnetic susceptibility was determined by two methods: a handheld Exploranium KT-5 kappameter and a desktop Magnon kappameter at the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM), University of Minnesota. Duplicate analyses of the same samples with both instruments indicates good comparability between the two datasets.

To investigate the influence of load on working memory, we asked human subjects to maintain sets of letters in memory while we recorded single neurons and intracranial encephalography (EEG) in the medial temporal lobe and scalp EEG. Along the periods of a trial, hippocampal neural firing differentiated between success and error trials during stimulus encoding, predicted workload during memory maintenance, and predicted the subjects’ behavior during retrieval. During maintenance, neuronal firing was synchronized with intracranial hippocampal EEG. On the network level, synchronization between hippocampal and scalp EEG in the theta-alpha frequency range showed workload dependent oscillatory coupling between hippocampus and cortex. Thus, we found that persistent neural activity in the hippocampus participated in working memory processing that is specific to memory maintenance, load sensitive and synchronized to the cortex.

How progenitors and their daughter cells are temporally patterned remains unknown. Here, we trace the transcriptional trajectories of successive generations of apical progenitors (APs) and isochronic cohorts of their daughter neurons in the developing mouse neocortex using high temporal resolution parallel single-cell RNA sequencing. We identify and functionally characterize a core set of evolutionarily-conserved temporally patterned genes which drive APs from internally-driven states to more exteroceptive states, revealing a progressively increasing role for extracellular signals as corticogenesis unfolds.

Interventions that aim to increase physical activity rely mainly on concrete, “subordinate” goals. Based on a goal-theoretical perspective, I argue that combining goals at different levels of abstraction may foster successful goal pursuit, particularly in the long run. In the present study, all participants committed to the subordinate goal of exercising three times per week for three weeks. A 2 × 2 between-subjects design was used to assign participants to an additional superordinate goal, concrete action steps, or both; a control group focused solely on the subordinate goal. The main outcome was exercise frequency, which was measured (a) in the short term, i.e., during the three-week intervention period, using self-reports and electronic data; and (b) in the long term, i.e., during a six-month follow-up period, using electronic data. For the self-reported frequency in the short term, the results show an interaction between a superordinate goal and action steps: In the absence of action steps, a superordinate goal had a negative effect, but this negative effect dissolved when action steps were present. Similarly, action steps exerted a positive effect in the presence of a superordinate goal, but this effect dissolved in the absence of a superordinate goal. When considering goal achievement (i.e., nine completed training sessions), the beneficial effect of a combination of superordinate goals and action steps and detrimental effect of focusing only on a superordinate goal or action steps was even more pronounced. Goal manipulation had no significant influence either in the short or long term for electronically measured exercise frequency. Possible explanations for the observed effects and the differences between self-reported and electronically measured exercise frequencies are discussed.",10.17605/OSF.IO/DA2MN,2019-08-15,https://osf.io/da2mn/?view_only=f642e330c8e84ff5964d2809e572ade2,Open Science Framework

A factor that may explain both patterns is attitude strength. A stronger (more favorable) attitude toward an issue may make the connections between related behaviors more salient and increase the motivation to work toward the underlying goal. We predicted that people with a stronger (more favorable) attitude are more likely to engage in subsequent behaviors that address an issue they care about. Two experiments tested the prediction in the contexts of pro-environmental and health behavior. Study 1 (N = 378) provided some support for the predicted moderating role of attitude toward the environment when participants recalled either an environmentally friendly or unfriendly action: A strong attitude increased the likelihood, whereas a weak attitude decreased the likelihood of carrying out successive goal-conducive behaviors. When compared to a neutral control condition in Study 2 (N = 929), participants with a weak environmental attitude supported pro-environmental petitions less strongly after an environmentally harmful action. Support for such petitions did not waver, however, among participants with a strong environmental attitude: They consistently acted environmentally friendly. Contrary to the hypothesis, in neither study did strength of attitude toward personal health moderate the effect of an initial behavior in the expected direction. In sum, the two studies provided only limited evidence for behavioral spillover: Participants mostly acted in accordance with their attitude but were hardly affected by recalling previous actions. When behavioral spillover did occur, however, a strong environmental attitude tended to increase the likelihood of acting in an environmentally friendly way, whereas the behavior of those with a weak attitude was less predictable. This research contributes to a more nuanced theoretical understanding of the role of attitude in spillover, but provides only limited evidence for its role as a moderator.",DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/MBGXH,2019-05-09,https://osf.io/mbgxh/,Open Science Framework
159379,01FDC9AB-8FC0-46B1-AF07-BA6F07CD6BC8,Spillover from a bike-to-work campaign,"Data and R Code for the paper ""Using a goal theoretical perspective to reduce negative and promote positive spillover after a bike-to-work campaign"".Behavioral change interventions often focus on a specific behavior over a limited time period; for example, a bike-to-work intervention that incentivizes cycling to work over 2 months. While such interventions can successfully initiate behavior, they run the risk of triggering negative spillover effects after completion: Reaching the end of an intervention could reduce the motivation to maintain the behavior; or an increase in the targeted behavior (e.g., cycling to work more often) could lead to negative spillover across behaviors (e.g., cycling less in leisure time). Using a goal theoretical perspective, we tested whether an intervention focusing on a specific behavior during a limited time period (a subordinate goal) triggers negative spillover, and whether superordinate goals and/or action steps reduce negative or promote positive spillover. We conducted an experimental field study (N = 1,269) in the context of a bike-to-work campaign with a longitudinal multilevel design. Participants across all four experimental conditions had the campaign goal of cycling to work for a maximum of 2 months (a subordinate goal). A quarter of the participants additionally generated superordinate goals, a quarter action steps and a quarter superordinate goals and action steps. The last quarter was a control condition which only set the subordinate campaign goal. Surprisingly, the intervention caused no negative and some positive spillover effects. Participants increased the frequency of cycling to work across all groups and the increase could be maintained up to 2 months after the campaign. An increase in cycling to work spilled over to an increase in cycling in leisure time and to an increase in eating fruits and vegetables. No spillover effects were found regarding exercising and eating sweets and snacks. Participants focusing additionally on a superordinate goal cycled to work more frequently at the end of the campaign than the control group. Contrary to our expectations, the maintenance of cycling to work over time and the positive spillover effects across behaviors did not differ due to the goal manipulation. These results reduce the concern that interventions focusing on a subordinate goal could trigger negative spillover effects and show the need for additional experimental field studies.",10.17605/OSF.IO/RX9BU,2020-03-06,https://osf.io/rx9bu/?view_only=e0daaebafb5d44418891216488b3e446,Open Science Framework

The expected bedrock depth was 115-119 m from two nearby hotwater drill holes. The ice core was retrieved using a thermal drill bit, i.e. that no mechanical stress was applied to the at least -0.5°C warm temperate ice. Furthermore, this procedure allowed an oriented retrieval of the ice. The site pointing towards east was marked using a soldering iron causing small gaps in the ice segments at both ends. Due to several technical issues the drilling was stopped at 45 m and continued in a new borehole approximately 80 cm down-glacier. The second hole was drilled down to 45 m with a hotwater drilling system before continuing a successful ice coring at 50 m. At 80 m the procedure was stopped again due to larger grains of gravel found in the ice. A total of 112 ice core segments with a mean diameter of 70 mm and a mean length of 700 mm were retrieved and stored at -25°C after transporting down the glacier.",10.1594/PANGAEA.888517,,https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.888517,PANGAEA

Essentially, clustering finds groups of related points in a dataset. However, results depend on both metrics for point-to-point similarity and rules for point-to-group association. Non-appropriate metrics and rules can lead to artifacts, especially in case of multiple groups with heterogeneous structure. In this work, we propose a clustering algorithm that evaluates the properties of paths between points (rather than point-to-point similarity) and solves a global optimization problem, finding solutions not obtainable by methods relying on local choices. Moreover, our algorithm is trainable. Hence, it can be adapted and adopted for specific datasets and applications by providing examples of valid and invalid paths to train a path classifier. We demonstrate its applicability to identify heterogeneous groups in challenging synthetic datasets, segment highly nonconvex immune cells in confocal microscopy images, and classify arrhythmic heartbeats in electrocardiographic signals.",10.1126/sciadv.aax3770,2019-10-30,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2019/10/25/5.10.eaax3770.DC1,Sciences advances - supplementary materials

164289,353B35E8-1E9F-4CF1-A694-ED58F8A9F707,Data from: A test of community assembly rules using foliar endophytes from a tropical forest canopy,"Community assembly theory assumes that ecological communities are spatially delimited into patches. Within these patches, coexistence results from environmental filtering, competition, and immigration. Truly delineated communities exist in laboratory studies of microbial cultures in Petri dishes, yet empirical tests conducted in continuous environments often use patches defined by convention as opposed to realised boundaries. Here we perform a test of ecological community assembly rules using foliar endophyte communities from a tropical rainforest, where leaves are considered as patches for both fungal and bacterial communities. We determined the diversity of fungal and bacterial endophytes using environmental DNA sequencing of 365 top-canopy leaves, collected from 38 host trees belonging to 22 different species across a 4-hectare research plot. Three leaves were collected from three or more branches within each tree crown. We tested the effect of host tree species and their level of phylogenetic relatedness on community composition as well as the contribution of geographic distance between leaves to endophyte community diversity.  Endophyte diversity significantly differed across host tree species, as did community composition. Within certain endophytic orders (Xylariales, Rhizobiales) species assemblages significantly differed across host tree species, but this trend was weaker or non-existent in other orders known to contain pathogens and saprotrophs (Polyporales, Solirubrobacterales). Phylogenetically related host tree species displayed more similar endophyte communities than expected by chance, but geographically close trees did not. Consistent with the finding of host-specificity, nearby leaves tended to host more similar communities than distantly positioned ones. These findings demonstrate that foliar endophytes are structured by dispersal across small spatial scales, but at the scale of the canopy they display patterns of neutral filtering, with only a small part of variation described by host tree differences. Endophyte communities thus act as a model system in evoking the rules predicted by theoretical community ecology.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bcc2fqz7v,2019-12-18,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bcc2fqz7v,dryad

Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are a powerful model for such tests because genotypes that underlie putatively adaptive traits have been identified. For example, a regulatory mutation in the Ectodysplasin (Eda) gene causes a reduction in the number of bony armor plates, which occurs rapidly and repeatedly when marine sticklebacks invade freshwater. However, the source of selection on plate loss in freshwater is unknown. Here, we tested whether dietary reduction of phosphorus can account for selection on plate loss due to a growth advantage of low-plated fish in freshwater. We crossed marine fish heterozygous for the 16 kilobase freshwater Eda haplotype and compared the growth of offspring with different genotypes under contrasting levels of dietary phosphorus in both saltwater and freshwater. Eda genotype was not associated with growth differences in any treatment, or with mechanisms that could mitigate the impacts of phosphorus limitation, like differential phosphorus deposition, phosphorus excretion, or intestine length. This study highlights the importance of experimentally testing the putative selective forces acting on phenotypes and their underlying genotypes in the wild.",https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9409-7541,2020-10-13,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.stqjq2c1d,Dryad

Here, we document a case of rapid divergence (over the past 100 generations or ~150 years) in foraging traits and feeding efficiency between a lake and stream population pair of threespine stickleback. Building on predictions from functional trait models of fish feeding, we analyzed foraging experiments with a Bayesian path analysis and elucidated the traits explaining variation in foraging performance and the species composition of ingested prey. Despite extensive previous research on the divergence of foraging traits among populations and ecotypes of stickleback, our results provide novel experimental evidence of trait utility for jaw protrusion, gill raker length, and gill raker spacing when foraging on a natural zooplankton assemblage. Furthermore, we discuss how these traits might contribute to the differential effects of lake and stream stickleback on their prey communities, observed in both laboratory and mesocosm conditions. More generally, our results illustrate how the rapid divergence of functional foraging traits of consumers can impact the biomass, species composition, and trophic structure of prey communities.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rk23t4,2020-11-02,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8rk23t4,Dryad

Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the impact of landscape changes. 2. Wildflower strips are ecological compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination services and biological control of crop pests, and to conserve insect diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species richness and abundance of the fauna. 3. We describe results from experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape, comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement, and of vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. 4. The proportion of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements, resulting in a more complex trap nest community with higher abundance and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food-web metrics. 5. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a potentially stable community of cavity nesting hymenoptera in wildflower strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial insect populations.",10.5061/dryad.ck842,2013-07-17,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.ck842,Dryad

Here, we applied partial Mantel tests (controlling for the other variable) on two datasets, the Jena (2002-2008) and the Grandcour (2008-2009) Experiment. In both experiments, plots were sown with different numbers of species to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Contrary to Jena, plots were not mowed nor weeded in Grandcour, allowing external species to establish. Based on the diversity-ecosystem functioning and competition theories, we tested two predictions: 1) the contribution of composition should increase with time; 2) the contribution of composition should be more important in non-weeded than in controlled systems. We found support for the second hypothesis, but not for the first. On the contrary, the contribution of species richness became markedly more important few years after the start of the Jena Experiment. This result can be interpreted as species complementarity, rather than intraspecific competition, being the driving force in this system. Finally, we explored to what extent the estimated relative importance of both factors could vary when measured on different spatial scales of the experiment (in our case, increasing the number of plots included in the analyses). We found a strong effect of scale, suggesting that comparisons between studies, and more generally the extrapolation of results from experiments to natural situations, should be made with caution.",10.5061/dryad.44bm6,2016-10-27,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.44bm6,Dryad

Furthermore, their thermal response during past extreme warming periods, such as super interglacials, is not fully resolved. In this regard, we present high-resolution (analytical) foraminiferal geochemical (δ^18^O and Mg/Ca) records for the last 1800 kyr from the shallow (487 m) Inner Sea drift deposits of the Maldives archipelago in the equatorial Indian Ocean. Considering the diagenetic susceptibility of these proxies, in carbonate-rich environments, we assess the integrity of a suite of commonly used planktonic and benthic foraminifera geochemical datasets (Globigerinoides ruber (white), Globigerinita glutinata (with bulla), Pulleniatina obliquiloculata (with cortex) and Cibicides mabahethi) and their use for future paleoceanographic reconstructions.Using a combination of spot Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer, Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer and Scanning Electron Microscope image data, it is evident that authigenic overgrowths are present on both the external and internal test (shell) surfaces, yet the degree down-core as well as the associated bias is shown to be variable across the investigated species and proxies. Given the elevated authigenic overgrowth Mg/Ca (∼12-22 mmol/mol) and δ^18^O values (closer to the benthic isotopic compositions) the whole-test planktonic G. ruber (w) geochemical records are notably impacted beyond ∼627.4 ka (24.7 mcd). Yet, considering the setting (i.e. bottom water location) for overgrowth formation, the benthic foraminifera δ^18^O record is markedly less impacted with only minor diagenetic bias beyond ∼790.0 ka (28.7 mcd). Even though only the top of the G. ruber (w) and C. mabahethi records (whole-test data) would be suitable for paleo-reconstructions of absolute values (i.e. sea surface temperature, salinity, seawater δ^18^O), the long-term cycles, while dampened, appear to be preserved. Furthermore, planktonic species with thicker-tests (i.e. P. obliquiloculata (w/c)) might be better suited, in comparison to thinner-test counter-parts (i.e. G. glutinata (w/b), G. ruber (w)), for traditional whole-test geochemical studies in shallow, carbonate-rich environments. A thicker test equates to a smaller overall bias from the authigenic overgrowth. Overall, if the diagenetic impact is constrained, as done in this study, these types of diagenetically altered geochemical records can still significantly contribute to studies relating to past tropical seawater temperatures, latitudinal scale ocean current shifts and South Asian Monsoon dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.914883,2020-09-01,https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.914883,Pangea
165852,71AC03C8-4915-4621-AEA4-91586BD2BF0E,geochemical data- Excel files,"Indian-Asian monsoon has oscillated between warm/wet interglacial periods and cool/dry glacial periods with periodicities closely linked to variations in Earth's orbital parameters. However, processes that control wet versus dry, i.e. aridity cyclical periods on the orbital time-scale in the low latitudes of the Indian-Asian continent remain poorly understood because records over millions of years are scarce. The sedimentary record from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 359 provides a well-preserved, high-resolution, continuous archive of lithogenic input from the Maldives reflecting on low-latitude aridity cycles. Variability within the lithogenic component of sedimentary deposits of the Maldives results from changes in monsoon-controlled sedimentary sources. Here, we present X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core-scanning results from IODP Site U1467 for the past two million years, allowing full investigation of orbital periodicities. We specifically use the Fe/K as a terrestrial climate proxy reflecting on wet versus dry conditions in the source areas of the Indian-Asian landmass, or from further afield. The Fe/K record shows orbitally forced cycles reflecting on changes in the relative importance of aeolian (stronger winter monsoon) during glacial periods versus fluvial supply (stronger summer monsoon) during interglacial periods. For our chronology, we tuned the Fe/K cycles to precessional insolation changes, linking Fe/K maxima/minima to insolation minima/maxima with zero phase lag. Wavelet and spectral analyses of the Fe/K record show increased dominance of the 100 kyr cycles after the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT) at 1.25 Ma in tandem with the global ice volume benthic δ18O data (LR04 record). In contrast to the LR04 record, the Fe/K profile resolves 100-kyr-like cycles around the 130 kyr frequency band in the interval from 1.25 to 2 million years. These 100-kyr-like cycles likely form by bundling of two or three obliquity cycles, indicating that low-latitude Indian-Asian climate variability reflects on increased tilt sensitivity to regional eccentricity insolation changes (pacing tilt cycles) prior to the MPT. The implication of appearance of the 100 kyr cycles in the LR04 and the Fe/K records since the MPT suggests strengthening of a climate link between the low and high latitudes during this period of climate transition.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-018-0238-x,2018-12-18,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-018-0238-x,Pangea

Here, we characterized biofilm communities inside 19 bath toys used under real conditions. In addition, some determinants for biofilm formation were assessed, using six identical bath toys under controlled conditions with either clean water prior to bathing or dirty water after bathing. All examined bath toys revealed notable biofilms on their inner surface, with average total bacterial numbers of 5.5 x 106 cells/cm2 (clean water controls), 9.5 x 106 cells/cm2 (real bath toys), and 7.3 x 107 cells/cm2 (dirty water controls). Bacterial community compositions were diverse, showing many rare taxa in real bath toys and rather distinct communities in control bath toys, with a noticeable difference between clean and dirty water control biofilms. Fungi were identified in 58 % of all real bath toys and in all dirty water control toys. Based on the comparison of clean water and dirty water control bath toys, we argue that bath toy biofilms are influenced by (1) the organic carbon leaching from the flexible plastic material, (2) the chemical and biological tap water quality, (3) additional nutrients by care products and human body fluids in the bath water, as well as, (4) additional bacteria from dirt and/or the end-users’ microbiome. The present study gives a detailed characterization of bath toy biofilms and a better understanding of determinants for biofilm formation and development in systems comprising plastic materials in contact with potable water.",PRJEB24750,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena,European Nucleotide Archive

Overall survival ranges from 2 to over 15 years depending on molecular and clinical factors. Hence, risk adjusted treatments are required to preserve cognitive function and quality of life. We aim at identifying mechanisms and associated molecular markers predicting benefit from radiotherapy (RT) or temozolomide (TMZ) on progression free survival in 120 isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDHmt) mutant LGG treated in the randomized phase III trial EORTC 22033. IDH mutations, the characteristic hallmark of LGG, are associated with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Given the genotoxic treatments in this study we determined the DNA methylome of DNA damage response (DDR) genes and assessed the association with progression free survival (PFS). We identified 62 functional CpGs corresponding to 24 of 410 DDR genes in the multidimensional LGG dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Despite the low-powered study, the simulations suggested that seven CpGs, associated with 4 genes could be predictive for PFS in EORTC 22033. Most interestingly, two of the CpGs correspond to MGMT and consisted of the 2 probes used in the MGMT-STP27 classifier. The extent of methylation was predictive for PFS in the TMZ, but not the RT arm. LGG IDHmt and 1p and 19q codeleted that overlap largely with oligodendroglioma displayed a higher extent of MGMT methylation than the IDHmt non-codeleted tumors based on several independent LGG datasets. This is consistent with a better PFS of codeleted patients in the TMZ arm as compared to the non-codeleted patients, while no difference was observed in the RT-arm.",GSE104293,2018-01-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=GSE104293[Accession],NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

This is achieved by mechanical stimuli and release of various signaling molecules by the equine embryo while migrating through the uterus. We hypothesized that embryo’s signals induce changes in the endometrial gene expression in a highly cell type-specific manner. A spatiotemporal transcriptomics approach was applied combining laser capture microdissection and low-input-RNA sequencing of luminal and glandular epithelium (LE, GE), and stroma of biopsy samples collected from days 10-13 of pregnancy and the estrous cycle. Two comparisons were performed, samples derived from pregnancies with conceptuses ≥ 8 mm in diameter (comparison 1) and conceptuses ≤ 8 mm (comparison 2) versus samples from cyclic controls. The majority of gene expression changes was identified in LE and much lower numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GE and stroma. While 1253 DEGs were found for LE in comparison 1, only 248 were found in comparison 2.

184813,0CA03186-FA64-4E72-AE85-DCF5E08EA166,Inhibition of firefly luciferase activity by a HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,"The three hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) 1-3 enzymes confer oxygen sensitivity to the HIF pathway and are novel therapeutic targets for treatment of renal anemia. Inhibition of the PHDs may further be beneficial in other hypoxia-associated diseases, including ischemia and chronic inflammation. Several pharmacologic PHD inhibitors (PHIs) are available, but our understanding of their selectivity and its chemical basis is limited. We here report that the PHI JNJ-42041935 (JNJ-1935) is structurally similar to the firefly luciferase substrate D-luciferin. Our results demonstrate that JNJ-1935 is a novel inhibitor of firefly luciferase enzymatic activity. In contrast, the PHIs FG-4592 (roxadustat) and FG-2216 (ICA, BIQ, IOX3, YM 311) did not affect firefly luciferase. The JNJ-1935 mode of inhibition is competitive with a Ki of 1.36 μM. D-luciferin did not inhibit the PHDs, despite its structural similarity to JNJ-1935. This study provides insights into a previously unknown JNJ-1935 off-target effect as well as into the chemical requirements for firefly luciferase and PHD inhibitors and may inform the development of novel compounds targeting these enzymes.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.905qfttjd,2020-10-28,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.905qfttjd,Dryad
184813,2F00E5FA-9692-4B85-99B7-05F405033EA0,Distal and proximal hypoxia response elements cooperate to regulate organ-specific erythropoietin gene expression,"While it is well-established that distal hypoxia response elements (HREs) regulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes such as erythropoietin (Epo), an interplay between multiple distal and proximal (promoter) HREs has not been described so far. Hepatic Epo expression is regulated by a HRE located downstream of the EPO gene, but this 3' HRE is dispensable for renal EPO gene expression. We previously identified a 5' HRE and could show that both HREs direct exogenous reporter gene expression. Here, we show that whereas in hepatic cells the 3' but not the 5' HRE is required, in neuronal cells both the 5' and 3' HREs contribute to endogenous Epo induction. Moreover, two novel putative HREs were identified in the EPO promoter. In hepatoma cells HIF interacted mainly with the distal 3' HRE, but in neuronal cells HIF most strongly bound the promoter, to a lesser extent the 3' HRE, and not at all the 5' HRE. Interestingly, mutation of either of the two distal HREs abrogated HIF binding to the 3' and promoter HREs. These results suggest that a canonical functional HRE can recruit multiple, not necessarily HIF, transcription factors to mediate HIF binding to different distant HREs in an organ-specific manner.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qfttdz0dd,2020-04-29,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.qfttdz0dd,Dryad

The reversibility of the observed changes was assessed by changing the composition of the wastewater from complex monomeric back to simple. The introduction of fermentable compounds in the influent changed dramatically the bacterial community but left the settling properties and nutrient removal performance unchanged, whereas the introduction of polymeric compounds induced small changes in the bacterial community but altered the settling properties and denitrification efficiency. The changes induced by the wastewater transition were only partly reversed. Seven distinct stables states of the bacterial community were detected during the 921 days of experiment, four of them observed with the complex monomeric wastewater. The transitions between these states were not only causes by wastewater changes but also by operation failures and other incidences. However, the nutrient removal performance and settling properties of the AGS were globally maintained due to the functional redundancy of its bacterial community.",ERP122292,2020-07-31,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB38840?show=reads,European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)

At the interface between such materials, this interplay can lead to phenomena that are present in none of the original constituents such as the formation of the interfacial two-dimensional electron system (2DES) discovered at the LAO3/STO3 (LAO/STO) interface. In samples prepared by growing a LAO layer onto a STO substrate, the 2DES is confined in a band bending potential well, whose width is set by the interface charge density and the STO dielectric properties, and determines the electronic band structure. Growing LAO (2 nm)/STO (x nm)/LAO (2 nm) heterostructures on STO substrates allows us to control the extension of the confining potential of the top 2DES via the thickness of the STO layer. In such samples, we explore the electronic structure trend under an increase of the confining potential with using soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with ab initio calculations. The results indicate that varying the thickness of the STO film modifies the quantization of the 3dt2g bands and, interestingly, redistributes the charge between the dxy and dxz/dyz bands.",10.26037/yareta:v22m3sedqfbu3bwji6sk6f5wmu,2020-03-09,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:v22m3sedqfbu3bwji6sk6f5wmu,Yareta

179239,06F548D3-980C-4791-8630-F592403AA852,Absence of NKG2D ligands defines human leukaemia stem cells and mediates their immune evasion,"Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often achieve remission yet subsequently die of disease relapse, which is commonly driven by chemotherapy-resistant leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). LSCs are defined by their capacity to initiate leukaemia in immuno-compromised mice. This precludes an analysis of their interaction with lymphocytes as components of anti-tumour immunity, which LSCs must escape in order to induce cancer7. Here we propose that stemness and immune evasion are closely intertwined in human AML. Using human AML xenograft and syngeneic mouse leukemia models, we show that ligands of the danger detector NKG2D, a critical mediator of anti-tumour immunity by cytotoxic lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells, are generally expressed on bulk AML cells but not on LSCs. Functional LSCs can be isolated by their lack of NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) expression, even in human AMLs not expressing the conventional LSC marker CD34. NKG2DL expressing AML cells are cleared by NK cells while NKG2DLneg leukaemic cells isolated from the same individuals escape NK cell killing. These NKG2DLneg AML cells show an immature morphology, display molecular and functional stemness characteristics, can initiate serially re-transplantable leukaemia and survive chemotherapy in patient-derived xenotransplants (PDX). Mechanistically, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) negatively regulates NKG2DL and PARP1 inhibition (PARPi) induces NKG2DL surface expression in LSCs. Consequently, co-treatment with PARPi and NK cells suppresses leukaemogenesis in PDX models. Low expression of surface NKG2DL as well as high PARP1 expression are associated with inferior clinical outcome in patients with AML. In summary, our data link the concept of LSCs to immune escape and indicate absence of immunostimulatory NKG2DL as a novel method to identify LSCs across genetic AML subtypes. Moreover, we provide a strong rationale for targeting therapy resistant LSCs by PARP1 inhibition rendering them amenable to NK cell control in vivo.",GSE127959,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127959,GEO

176384,E8A907FF-BD14-406F-875C-ACC736EBDEA5,Measuring the complexity of global value chains: a database of the network structure of trade,"We describe the construction of an extensive set of global value chain (GVC) participation and network indicators for 141 countries in the years 2004, 2007, 2011, 2014, and 2017. These measures are constructed from one of the most detailed input-output (IO) databases available which covers data on production and trade for 65 sectors in all of the regions and years included in the database. We describe how the raw IO data is extended to a global multi-region input-output (MRIO) table which captures complex transactions between all sectors and regions in the database. From these MRIO tables we derive a detailed database on bilateral trade in value added (TiVA). Both sources, the MRIO tables and the TiVA measures, are the basis for a range of measures for the participation of the regions in our database in arbitrarily complex global value chain activities. Indicators capturing the foreign and domestic content of bilateral gross exports and domestic sales round up the measures on GVC partic- ipation. We complement these data with a set of detailed network indicators for all regions considered. The database accompanying this documentation is the main output of Work Package 1 of the project “Complexity - Complexity and the structure and regulation of trade and investment” funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).",https://dx.doi.org/10.7892/boris.148203,2020-11-06,https://boris.unibe.ch/id/eprint/148203,Valentino Desilvestro

As they do, they generate swarms of seismic signals, frequently used for forecasting. In this study we pressurize and inject molten acrylic into an encapsulating host rocks of (1) Etna basalt and (2) Comiso limestone, at 30 MPa of confining pressure. Fracture was achieved at 12 MPa for Etna basalt and 7.2 MPa for Comiso limestone. The generation of radial fractures was accompanied by acoustic emissions (AE) at a dominant frequency of 600 kHz. During “magma” movement in the dykes, AE events of approximately 150 kHz dominant frequency were recorded. We interpret our data using AE location and dominant frequency analysis, concluding that the seismicity associated with magma transport in dykes peaks during initial dyke creation but remains significant as long as magma movement continues.

Recordings were made using subdural strip and grid electrodes as well as depth electrodes.  From each night recording, up to six sample intervals, each containing five minutes of interictal slow-wave sleep were selected for inclusion in the data set. In the sample intervals we detected high frequency oscillations (HFO) and the start and ending times of these events are included in the data set.  The HFO events were detected using a previously validated, automated algorithm (Burnos et al., 2016) in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and the fast ripple (FR, 250-500 Hz) frequency band.  Contacts with the highest rate of ripples co-occurring with FR over several five-minute time intervals designated the HFO area.The motivation for collecting these data is that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are recognized as biomarkers for epileptogenic brain tissue. A remaining challenge for epilepsy surgery is the prospective classification of tissue sampled by individual electrode contacts.   For the 20 patients from which this data was collected, it was shown that resection of the prospectively defined HFO area proved to be highly specific and reproducible in 13/13 patients with seizure freedom, while it may have improved the outcome in 4/7 patients with recurrent seizures.",10.6080/K06Q1VD5,2017-12-01,http://crcns.org/data-sets/methods/ieeg-1/,CRCNS - Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience   - Data sharing

Stimuli were presented in a block design. The paradigm consisted of eight activation and eight baseline blocks each lasting 24 seconds. The activation condition consisted of 75 brief episodes (2 to 3 seconds) from thriller and horror films. All episodes showed the faces of actors who were expressing fear with high intensity. None of the episodes showed violence or aggression. Quality and applicability of film sequences were evaluated by an expert panel consisting of nine psychologists. Of an initial collection of 120 scenes, only sequences that were considered appropriate by the majority of the expert panel were extracted for the paradigm. Evaluation criteria were as follows: 1) actor’s face is clearly visible; 2) emotion displayed is clearly recognizable as fear; 3) fear is the only clearly recognizable emotion (no other emotion, e.g., anger, sadness, surprise, is displayed); and (4) the fear displayed is of high intensity. During baseline blocks, 72 short episodes of similar length (2 to 3 seconds) with dynamic landscape video recordings were presented. Video clips of dull domestic landscapes were used owing to their stable low emotional content while their general visual stimulus properties were comparable with the movie clips. Frequency and duration of the sequences (2 to 3 seconds) were matched for activation and control conditions.""",http://www.neurobs.com/ex_files/expt_view?id=283,2020-04-18,https://www.neurobs.com/ex_files/expt_view?id=283,Neurobehavioral Systems

Current state-of-the-art synchrotron-based tomographic phase-contrast imaging methods allow for three-dimensional microscopic imaging data to be acquired non-destructively in scan times of the order of seconds with good soft tissue contrast. However, when studying multi-scale hierarchically structured objects, such as the mammalian lung, the overall sample size typically exceeds the field of view illuminated by the X-rays in a single scan, and the necessity for achieving a high spatial resolution conflicts with the need to image the whole sample. Several image-stitching and calibration techniques to achieve extended high-resolution fields of view have been reported, but those approaches tend to fail when imaging non-stable samples, thus precluding tomographic measurements of large biological samples, which are prone to degradation and motion during extended scan times. In this work, we demonstrate a full-volume three-dimensional reconstruction of an intact rat lung under immediate post mortem conditions and at an isotropic voxel size of (2.75 µm)^3. We present the methodology for collecting multiple local tomographies with 360 degree extended field of view scans followed by locally non-rigid volumetric stitching. Applied to the lung, it allows to resolve the entire pulmonary structure from the trachea down to the parenchyma in a single dataset.

Previous research highlighted the positive effect of subordinate goals in goal pursuit. We argue that combining superordinate and subordinate goals contributes to successful goal pursuit, especially in the long run. We test whether a simultaneous focus on both goal types helps people to keep their resolutions.MethodsUsing a 2 × 2 between‐subjects design, participants (N = 256) formulated a resolution from which they derived either a superordinate (yes/no) or a subordinate goal (yes/no). The control group focused exclusively on a self‐set resolution. Main outcome measures were effort in goal pursuit and intentions to further pursue the goal after 3 months.ResultsFocusing on superordinate and subordinate goals increased the amount of effort invested in goal pursuit. A group difference was found only between the group focusing on both goal types and the group focusing on a superordinate goal. No statement could be made about intentions for further goal pursuit and processes by which goal type affects goal pursuit.ConclusionThe study provides preliminary insights into how combining superordinate and subordinate goals may be a helpful strategy to pursue long‐term goals.",10.17605/OSF.IO/VRWZP,2019-06-24,https://osf.io/vrwzp/?view_only=fb0c5b5552fe43a382fbec5f987daff1,Open Science Framework

It consists of 70000 images (60000 for training and 10000 for test) of 28 x 28 = 784 dimensions.The spoken digits database was extracted from Google Speech Commands [3], an audio dataset of spoken words that was proposed to train and evaluate keyword spotting systems. It consists of 105829 utterances of 35 words, amongst which 38908 utterances of the ten digits (34801 for training and 4107 for test). A pre-processing was done via the extraction of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with a framing window size of 50 ms and frame shift size of 25 ms. Since the speech samples are approximately 1 s long, we end up with 39 time slots. For each one, we extract 12 MFCC coefficients with an additional energy coefficient. Thus, we have a final vector of 39 x 13 = 507 dimensions. Standardization and normalization were applied on the MFCC features.To construct the multimodal digits dataset, we associated written and spoken digits of the same class respecting the initial partitioning in [2] and [3] for the training and test subsets. Since we have less samples for the spoken digits, we duplicated some random samples to match the number of written digits and have a multimodal digits database of 70000 samples (60000 for training and 10000 for test).The dataset is provided in six files as described below. Therefore, if a shuffle is performed on the training or test subsets, it must be performed in unison with the same order for the written digits, spoken digits and labels.",10.5281/zenodo.4452953,2020-10-01,https://zenodo.org/record/4452953#.YV1qDXvRaV5,Zenodo

Tactile myography (TMG) was used to measure the muscles activations during finger and wrist movements. 54 tasks were administrated to 9 intact participants (6 movements used for training at 3 activation levels, repeated 3 times). Half of the participants began with Ridge regression (RR), while the other half began with Gaussian process regression (GPR). For each task, a virtual hand model would perform a movement to either one-third, two-third or full activation. The participant controlled a second hand model and were asked to have it mimic the action of the first one.In experiment 2, the participants were asked to imitate the movement of a hand model. They were presented three times the same sequence of six movements. The data consist in surface electromyography (sEMG) and TMG measurement. They were recorded during the whole cycle of each stimuli in order to obtain the whole range of activation from rest to complete finger and wrist movement.",-,2017-08-11,https://www.idiap.ch/paper/mdpi/,Combining Electromyography and Tactile Myography to Improve Hand and Wrist Activity Detection in Prostheses

Here we show that the genetic deletion of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme DICER in TAMs broadly programs them to a CD11c+MRC1−/low M1-like immunostimulatory phenotype characterized by activated interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/STAT1/IRF signaling. M1-like TAM programming fostered the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), including tumor-antigen-specific CTLs, inhibited tumor growth, and enhanced the efficacy of PD1 checkpoint blockade. Bioinformatics analysis of TAM transcriptomes identified a limited set of miRNAs putatively involved in TAM programming. Re-expression of Let-7 in Dicer-deficient TAMs was sufficient to partly rescue the M2-like (protumoral) TAM phenotype and abate tumor CTL infiltration. Targeted suppression of DICER activity in TAMs may, therefore, stimulate antitumor immunity and enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",GSE76356,2016-07-01,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76356,NCBI GEO

It provides one specific way to address the question how inter‐city relations can be empirically measured despite the chronic lack of data on inter‐city information flows. The model uses a proxy - intra‐firm networks of multi‐branch, multi‐location enterprises - to estimate potential flows of knowledge‐creating information between cities and towns. The method was originally developed to measure the connectivity between global cities based on multi‐branch advanced producer services (APS) firms as they organize business activities across their offices worldwide. In this dataset, the model is adapted to measure relations between functional urban areas (FUAs) within and beyond the German and Swiss space economy, for both APS and High-Tech firms.

The virus modulates the host cellular machinery in orderto support its life cycle, while counteracting intracellular defense mechanisms. We investigated thedynamic host response to HIV-1 infection by systematically measuring transcriptomic, proteomic,and phosphoproteomic expression changes in infected and uninfected SupT1 CD4+ T cells at five timepoints of the viral replication process. By means of a Gaussian mixed-effects model implemented in thenew R/Bioconductor package TMixClust, we clustered host genes based on their temporal expressionpatterns. We identified a proteo-transcriptomic gene expression signature of 388 host genes specificfor HIV-1 replication. Comprehensive functional analyses of these genes confirmed the previouslydescribed roles of some of the genes and revealed novel key virus-host interactions affecting multiplemolecular processes within the host cell, including signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, andimmune system. The results of our analysis are accessible through a freely available, dedicated and userfriendly R/Shiny application, called PEACHi2.0.

The second hole was drilled down to 45 m with a hotwater drilling system before continuing a successful ice coring at 50 m. At 80 m the procedure was stopped again due to larger grains of gravel found in the ice.

164289,E32C2925-09A5-42C3-B372-A42DD34F6AC6,Tropical palm endophytes exhibit low competitive structuring when assessed using co-occurrence and antipathogen activity analysi,"Leaf-inhabiting fungal and bacterial endophytes are at their most diverse in tropical rainforest plant hosts, with some influencing host plant fitness as either symbionts or pathogens. Endophyte activity and community composition is thought to depend on competition amongst co-occurring species for resources. Here, we reveal the strength of competitive interactions between endophytes by combining e-DNA metabarcoding to characterize the community with culturing assays to ascertain their potential activity. The endophyte community associated with the understory palm Astrocaryum sciophilum was determined by extracting eDNA from 120 leaflets of eight plants located in a lowland rainforest in French Guiana. This revealed 516 fungal and 606 bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Co-occurrence analysis of the most abundant OTUs revealed that direct fungal-fungal interactions were overall more negative than bacterial-bacterial interactions. This was confirmed by C-score calculations for the whole endophyte community, revealing significantly greater levels of species segregation for fungi but not bacteria when compared with simulated random communities. Following the culturing of 131 fungal, and 66 bacterial Astrocaryum endophytes collected from the same leaves, Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of ethyl acetate culture extracts were evaluated against the fungus Trichophyton rubrum and the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.  Overall, a minority of extracts demonstrated antipathogen activity, with greater antifungal activity expression for both fungi and bacteria when compared with antibacterial activity. In order to explore whether this activity translated into competitive structuring of the community, a BLAST was conducted to match metabarcoding sequences with Sanger derived culture sequences. This demonstrated that cultures displaying antipathogen activity were significantly more likely to co-occur with fungi if they were bacteria, and bacteria if they were fungi. Nevertheless, overall correlation values averaged around zero. These results indicate that for Astrocaryum palms, fungal endophytes are likely to play a greater role in determining colonization success of subsequent endophytes whether these be fungal or bacterial, but that overall endophyte communities do not display strong patterns of community structuring through competition. Endophyte communities are thus likely to reach relative stasis in mature leaves, where the diverse community of fungi and bacteria amongst other factors prevent the subsequent establishment of pathogens.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jsxksn055,2020-01-10,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jsxksn055,DRYAS

Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an Eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a Western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e. the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.",https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.34c4889,2019-06-20,https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.34c4889,Dryad

138489,4AB00A4F-D0A6-4181-AD55-21B86941C58A,Data from: Including community composition in biodiversity-productivity models,"1. Studies on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) have elicited debate over the interpretation of the positive relationship between species richness and plant productivity. Manipulating richness cannot be achieved without affecting composition; it is thus essential to consider the latter in statistical models. 2. We firstly review existing approaches that use species richness as an explanatory variable and propose modifications to improve their performance. We use an original dataset to illustrate the analyses. The classical method where composition is coded as a factor with a level for each different species mixture can be improved by defining the levels using clustering. Methods based on ordinations reduce the dimensionality of plant composition and use the new coordinates as fixed effects; they provide a much better fit to our observations. 3. Secondly, we develop a new method where composition is included as a similarity matrix affecting the residual variance-covariance. Similarity in composition between plots is treated in the same way as shared evolutionary history between species in phylogenetic regression. We find that it outperforms the other models. 4. We discuss the different approaches and suggest that our method is particularly suited for observational studies or for manipulative studies where plant diversity is not kept constant by weeding.

Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. The matching term quantifies the assortative structure in which node makes links with which other node, while the centrality term quantifies the number of links that nodes make. We show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition can provide a tight fit to observed networks. Then we provide three applications. First, we show that the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteris- tics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics ex- plain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node would create if it were to join an existing network.",10.5061/dryad.5fn84,2016-01-11,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5fn84,Dryad

Here, by combining molecular biology, photoactivation and FA-isolation experiments, we demonstrate specific contributions of each LIM domain of paxillin and reveal multiple paxillin interactions in adhesion-complexes. Mutation of β3 integrin at a putative paxillin binding site (β3 VE/YA ) leads to rapidly inward-sliding FAs, correlating with actin retrograde flow and enhanced paxillin dissociation kinetics. Induced mechanical coupling of paxillin to β3 VE/YA integrin arrests the FA-sliding, thereby disclosing an essential structural function of paxillin for the maturation of β3 integrin/talin clusters. Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation unveils the spatial orientation of the paxillin LIM-array, juxtaposing the positive LIM4 to the plasma membrane and the β3 integrin-tail, while in vitro binding assays point to LIM1 and/or LIM2 interaction with talin-head domain. These data provide structural insights into the molecular organization of β3 integrin-FAs.",10.26037/yareta:23jacb27ibdm5erlqxcdluzwrm,2021-02-03,https://yareta.unige.ch/#/home/detail/81a01062-aea3-4d2b-a26d-7181cc18cf9a,Yareta.unige.ch

Yet, little consensus exists about the effectiveness of their monitoring and enforcement practices or their ultimate impact.ContextSince the 1990s, the concern has intensified about the responsibility of businesses in global subcontracting chains for exploitation of labour, inequality, and pollution. Many private transnational regulatory initiatives claim to address this concern by incentivizing multinational companies to voluntary sign up to human rights and environmental standards often referring to, for example, the International Labour Organization’s core labour standards. The effectiveness of this approach remains a complex and highly debated issue.Over the last decade, scholars have studied the emergence, performance and problems related to transnational private labour regulation, their interactions on the transnational level and local level compliance. Stepping back from conventional debates on the overall effectiveness of transnational private governance, the project focuses instead on agency: the effect of transnational private labour regulation on the capacity of those involved, especially workers, to act in local contexts. With our project, we explore how different types of transnational private labour regulation, different national settings and different firm-level contexts of application combine to form what we call transnational hybrid production regimes.AimThe study examines how these regimes support workers’ collective capacity to take action to improve their own conditions of employment.",10.23662/FORS-DS-1180-1,2020-07-08,https://forsbase.unil.ch/project/study-public-overview/16999/0/,FORSBase

Interestingly, experiments have shown that on certain substrates, water dimers can diffuse more rapidly than water monomers. Whilst explanations for anomalously fast diffusion have been presented for specific systems, the general underlying physical principles are not yet established. We investigate this through a systematic ab initio study of water monomer and dimer diffusion on a range of surfaces. Calculations reveal different mechanisms for fast water dimer diffusion, which is found to be more widespread than previously anticipated. The key factors affecting diffusion are the balance of water-water versus water-surface bonding and the ease with which hydrogen-bond exchange can occur (either through a classical over-the-barrier process or through quantum-mechanical tunnelling). We anticipate that the insights gained will be useful for understanding future experiments on the diffusion and clustering of hydrogen-bonded adsorbates.",10.1038/s41467-020-15377-8,2020-12-03,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15377-8,Supporting Information

We hypothesize that these signals could be packed into uterine extracellular vesicles (uEVs), acting as multi-signal messengers between the conceptus and the maternal tract and contributing to MRP. To unveil these signals, the RNA and protein cargos of uEVs isolated from uterine lavages collected from pregnant mares (P; day 10, 11, 12 and 13 after ovulation) and cyclic control mares (C; day 10 and 13 after ovulation) were analyzed. Our results showed a fine-tuned regulation of the uEV cargo (RNAs and proteins), by the day of pregnancy, the estrous cycle, and even the size of the embryo. A particular RNA pattern was identified with specific increase on P12 related to immune system and hormonal response. Besides, a set of proteins as well as RNAs was highly enriched in EVs on P12 and P13. Differential abundance of miRNAs was also identified in P13-derived uEVs. Their target genes were linked to down- or upregulated genes in the embryo and the endometrium, exposing their potential origin. Our study identified for the first time specific molecules packed in uEVs, which were previously associated to MRP in the mare, and thus bringing added value to the current knowledge. Further integrative and functional analyses will help to confirm the role of these molecules in uEVs during MRP in the mare.",PRJNA817576,2022-03-18,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA817576,NCBI SRA

Here, we show that unlike wild type yeast chromosomes, non-chromosomal DNA circles and chromosomes lacking a centromere fail to condense during mitosis. Genetics and ChIP-seq experiments establish that the centromere functions in chromosome condensation upstream of the kinases Aurora B and Bub1. Downstream of Aurora B and Bub1, Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading of the condensation signal from the pericentromeric region to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes, or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles. Our data indicate that yeast cells license in a centromere-dependent manner the chromosome-autonomous condensation of their chromatin, excluding non-centromeric DNA from this process and thereby inhibiting their propagation.",GEO: GSE100643,2018-10-11,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100643,Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

173157,DD94ABAC-BFBE-4BF7-9994-A475C3A8FA42,RILD,"Introduction: High dose irradiation is an essential tool to help control the growth of hepatic tumors, but has the cost of increasing the risk of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). This life-threatening consequence manifests itself months following radiation therapy and is hallmarked by fibrosis of the pericentral sinusoids resulting in sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). In this study, we aimed to establish a mouse model of RILD to use to investigate the underlying mechanism of SOS.Methods: A small animal image-guided RT platform was used to design an irradiation scheme delivering 50Gy as a single dose to a focal point in the liver. Tissues were analyzed 1- and 6- days, 6- and 20-weeks post-irradiation. Liver histology was assessed by H&E and immunohistochemistry. The transcriptome of irradiation livers was analyzed by RNA sequencing and mitochondria function was assessed using high-resolution respirometry.Results:  At 6- and 20-weeks post irradiation, features of SOS were visible in highly irradiated areas, including the presence of ceroid-containing macrophages, matrix deposition around the central veins, and extravasation of red blood cells. The RNAseq analysis showed gene signatures associated with acute DNA damage, cell death, markers of fibrosis and mitochondrial damage and an increase in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy. Mitochondrial damage was verified by a decrease in complex I activity in irradiated hepatocytes in vitro. Finally, highly irradiated areas showed increased lipid peroxides and a senescence-like phenotype associated with the developing fibrosis.Conclusions: Based on our murine model of RILD, we propose irradiation-induced mtDNA instability contributes to the development of SOS by the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species, p53 pathway activation and a senescence-like phenotype.",nan,2022-12-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE179782,GSE179782
159713,7C599A9C-A544-4D91-A0FD-58EB6E9650BF,Training Set for the Prediction of Partial Charges,"Parametrization of small organic molecules for classical molecular dynamics simulations is not trivial. The vastness of the chemical space makes approaches using building blocks challenging. The most common approach is therefore an invidual parametrization of each compound by deriving partial charges from semi-empirical or ab initio calculations and inheriting the bonded and van der Waals (Lennard-Jones) parameters from a biomolecular force field. The quality of the partial charges generated in this fashion depends on the level of the quantum-chemical calculation as well as on the extraction procedure used. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based approach for predicting partial charges extracted from density functional theory (DFT) electron densities. The training set was chosen with the goal to provide a broad coverage of the known chemical space of drug-like molecules. In addition to the speed of the approach, the partial charges predicted by ML are not dependent on the molecular conformation in contrast to the ones obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP).",https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000230799,2018-01-31,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/230799,ETH Research Collection

Yet, myelin-specific imaging of macroscopic samples remains a challenge. Here, we exploit myelin’s nanostructural periodicity, and use small-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography (SAXS-TT) to simultaneously quantify myelin levels, nanostructural integrity and axon orientations in nervous tissue. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated in whole mouse brain, mouse spinal cord and human white and gray matter samples. Outcomes are validated by 2D/3D histology and compared to MRI measurements sensitive to myelin and axon orientations. Specificity to nanostructure is exemplified by concomitantly imaging different myelin types with distinct periodicities. Finally, we illustrate the method’s sensitivity towards myelin-related diseases by quantifying myelin alterations in dysmyelinated mouse brain. This non-destructive, stain-free molecular imaging approach enables quantitative studies of myelination within and across samples during development, aging, disease and treatment, and is applicable to other ordered biomolecules or nanostructures.",https://doi.org/10.16907/0cf7e016-9ac1-4546-8eca-bb59c1a61e34,2021-05-19,https://doi.org/10.16907/0cf7e016-9ac1-4546-8eca-bb59c1a61e34,PSI Public Data Repository

It has thus been difficult to determine how novelties arise. Zheng et al. allowed bacterial populations to accumulate mutations and then used directed evolution to evolve green fluorescent protein function from a gene that expressed yellow fluorescent protein (see the Perspective by Lee and Marx). Protein alternatives could evolve in cases where cryptic alleles-selectively neutral or mildly deleterious genetic variants with no apparent phenotypic differences-were present in the population. Thus, cryptic alleles provide an evolutionary bridge between diversity and selection and facilitate the generation of novel adaptations.

Robustness is a measure of the ability to withstand deleterious mutational effects. Zheng et al. exposed Escherichia coli populations expressing a yellow fluorescent protein to strong, weak, or no selection for yellow fluorescence for four generations. They then selected these populations to a related function, green fluorescence, for four more generations. The strong selection first for yellow and then green fluorescence resulted in the most green fluorescence and the accumulation of the most mutations. This outcome likely was due to the increased foldability of the protein. Selection thus provides a threshold for mutation accumulation, but robustness maintains a buffer necessary for protein evolution.

We image using phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy propagating spin waves in a one-dimensional magnonic crystal consisting of dipolarly coupled magnetic nanostripes. We demonstrate phase shifts upon a single nanostripe of opposed magnetization. Using micromagnetic simulations, we model our experimental finding in a wide parameter space of bias fields and wave vectors. We find that low-loss phase inversion is achieved, when the internal field of the oppositely magnetized nanostripe is tuned such that the latter supports a resonant standing spin wave mode with an odd quantization number at the given frequency. Our results are key for the realization of phase inverters with optimized signal transmission.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4680409,,https://zenodo.org/record/4680409#.YHgQRT_RY2w,Zenodo

In the quest for tailor-made materials it is essential to be able to control the structural properties of the compound(s) of interest. Here, thin film solid solutions that combine NdNiO3 and LaNiO3, two materials with perovskite structure but distinct space-groups, are analyzed. Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy are combined in a synergistic approach to fully determine the mechanism of the structural crossover with chemical composition. It is found that the symmetry transition is achieved by phase coexistence in a way that depends upon the substrate selected. These results carry implications for analog-tuning of physical properties in future functional materials based on these compounds.",10.26037/yareta:oonzm7k6kfcajgiihcffkxjhci,2021-07-14,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:oonzm7k6kfcajgiihcffkxjhci,Yareta

Femtosecond laser pulses with a photon energy of 0.61 eV, resonant with electron transfer between long-bond and short-bond nickel sites, are used to excite the material and drive an ultrafast insulator-metal transition. Polarization-sensitive soft x-ray diffraction, resonant to the nickel L3 edge, then probes the evolution of the underlying magnetic spiral as a function of time delay with 80 ps time resolution. By modeling the azimuthal dependence of the scattered intensity for different linear x-ray polarizations, we benchmark the changes of the local magnetic moments and the spin alignment. The measured changes are consistent with a reduction of the long-bond site magnetic moments and an alignment of the spins towards a more collinear structure at early time delays.",10.26037/yareta:jlgb332yujdltoujpg4no76ubm,2020-12-11,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:jlgb332yujdltoujpg4no76ubm,Yareta

Such rotations can be tuned by preparing thin films in which dimensionality, strain, and interface effects come into play. However, little is known of the tilt and rotational distortions in films a few unit cells thick including the question of if coherent tilt patterns survive at all in this ultrathin limit. Here, a series of films of perovskite LaNiO3 is studied and it is shown that the phonon mode related to oxygen octahedral tilts can be followed by Raman spectroscopy down to a film thickness of three pseudocubic perovskite unit cells (∼1.2 nm). To push the limits of resolution to the ultrathin regime, a statistical analysis method is introduced to separate the Raman signals of the film and substrate. Most interestingly, these analyses reveal a pronounced hardening of the tilt vibrational mode in the thinnest films. A comparison between the experimental results, first principles simulations of the atomic structure, and the standing wave model, which accounts for size effects on the phononic properties, reveals that in the ultrathin regime, the Raman spectra are a hybrid entity of both the bulk and surface phononic behavior. These results showcase Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool to probe the behavior of perovskite films down to the ultrathin limit.",10.26037/yareta:g5dhhgcumnbshbxywnxhu4xyya,2020-06-02,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:g5dhhgcumnbshbxywnxhu4xyya,Yareta

Here, we use a resonant magnetic X-ray scattering nanoprobe with sub-100 nm spatial resolution to directly visualize the texture of antiferromagnetic domains in NdNiO3. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a highly textured magnetic fabric, which we show to be robust and nonvolatile even after thermal erasure across its ordering temperature. The scalefree distribution of antiferromagnetic domains and its non-integral dimensionality point to a hitherto-unobserved magnetic fractal geometry in this system. These scale-invariant textures directly reflect the continuous nature of the magnetic transition and the proximity of this system to a critical point. The present study not only exposes the near-critical behavior in rare earth nickelates but also underscores the potential for X-ray scattering nanoprobes to image the multiscale signatures of criticality near a critical point.",10.26037/yareta:acqfapvmkrflzaz2xdzik56kgi,2019-10-15,https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:acqfapvmkrflzaz2xdzik56kgi,Yareta

They are closely related and appear to have overlapping functions, regulators, and effectors. The functional specificity of individual Arfs and the extent of redundancy are still largely unknown. We addressed these questions by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the human class I (Arf1/3) and class II (Arf4/5) Arfs, either individually or in combination. Most knockout cell lines were viable with slight growth defects only when lacking Arf1 or Arf4. However, Arf1+4 and Arf4+5 could not be deleted simultaneously. Class I Arfs are nonessential, and Arf4 alone is sufficient for viability. Upon Arf1 deletion, the Golgi was enlarged, and recruitment of vesicle coats decreased, confirming a major role of Arf1 in vesicle formation at the Golgi. Knockout of Arf4 caused secretion of ER-resident proteins, indicating specific defects in coatomer-dependent ER protein retrieval by KDEL receptors. The knockout cell lines will be useful tools to study other Arf-dependent processes.",PXD028846,2022-01-03,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028846,PRIDE

The spontaneous symmetry breaking and resultant ferroelectric polarization of the conventional ferroelectric materials are strongly coupled to the crystal field. However, near the morphotropic phase boundary, especially the boundary between the tetragonal and the rhombohedral phases, the macroscopic polarization is decoupled from the crystal field and manifests isotropic behavior. On the mesoscopic scale, the high density of chemical defects and the corresponding stoichiometric inhomogeneity stabilize the polar slush structure. The theoretical model based on the Landau theory is developed, and the generality of isotropic nature at the morphotropic phase boundary is predicted by the model. We investigated experimentally a PIN-PMN-PT single crystal as a model system, and visualized the nanoscale polarization field by the angle-resolved lateral piezoresponse force microscopy (AR-LPFM) revealing the polarization distribution similar to that obtained by our simulations.",10.5281/zenodo.5730294,2021-11-25,https://zenodo.org/record/5730294#.Yd3Ezywo9-8,zenodo

Their appearance can result from paclitaxel treatment or hypoxia, two conditions known to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. PGCCs produced under hypoxia may be formed by cell fusion and can contribute by bursting and budding to the generation of cancer stem-like cells which have a more aggressive phenotype than the parental cells. Despite the fact that PGCCs may contribute to tumor maintenance and recurrence, they were poorly studied. Here, we confirmed that PGCCs could derive, at least in part, from cell fusion. We also observed that PGCCs nuclei were able to fuse. The resulting cells were able to proliferate by mitosis and were more invasive than the parental cancer cells. Using two different ovarian cancer cell lines (COV318 and SKOV3), we showed that UPR activation with chemical inducers increased cell fusion and PGCCs appearance. Down-regulation of the UPR-associated protein PERK expression partially reversed the UPR-induced PGCCs formation, suggesting that the PERK arm of the UPR is involved in ovarian PGCCs onset.",DOI,2020-01-24,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.918029,BioRIX

Scanning was carried out using a single specimen using a Phoenix nanotom m from GE Sensing & Inspection Technologies GmbH. Exposure to hard x-rays was during about 4 hours and 1440 equiangular radiographs were taken along 360°. From the 2108 virtual slices through the stack visualizations of internal microstructures of the calcareous test and sarcode reconstruction were generated after segmentation and rendering in AVIZO7 software from FEI Visualization Sciences Group and using Voxler2 software from Golden Software, LLC. The 2.6 GB set including raw images, derived stacks of AVIZO labels, and video representations illustrating the interior of the Borelis specimen is put on line in form of a zipped archive for further experimentation by the community and for usage in micropaleontological training classes. The archive comprises the original stack of dicom images generated by the nanotom device, a reduced stack of derived AVIZO7 files and labels illustrating the reconstructed inner structures and rendered surfaces, a second reduced data stack of dicom images for loading and experimentation with ImageJ and Voxler2 software, an Excel-sheet containing volume measurements of individual segmented chambers and chamberlets.In addition, several videos (GIF, AVI, MPEG) are provided illustrating the growth of the sarcode body from embryonic stage to adult stage, and showing the shell architecture of the investigated Borelis specimen in animated series of vertical slices.Using the presented data requires access to AVIZO7 and / or Voxler2, which are commercial software.

In P. falciparum heterochromatin is formed after trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 and consequent binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Genome-wide profiling studies established that in P. falciparum blood stage schizonts heterochromatin is formed at subtelomeres and some intra-chromosomal islands. Reversible silencing of genes located in these regions has been shown to be key to, among others, antigenic variation, invasion pathway selection or commitment to gametocytogenesis. However, heterochromatic gene silencing has not been investigated in many other Plasmodium species, strains or life cycle stages, yet. Here, we used ChIP-seq to profile HP1 occupancy in asexual parasites of six different species (P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. vivax, P. berghei, P. yoelii, and P. chabaudi) and of four different P. falciparum strains (3D7, PF2004, NF54, NF135) as well as two different P. knowlesi clones (A1C1, A1H1). Additionally, we performed HP1 ChIP-seq on three asexual stages (ring, trophozoite and schizont stage) and two sexual stages of P. falciparum parasites. Collectively, the generated HP1 profiles provide a detailed catalog of heterochromatic genes and reveal conserved and specialized features of epigenetic control at different life cycle stages, strains and species across the genus Plasmodium.",doi: 10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.008,2018-03-01,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102695,GEO
163258,206CF5AD-F543-4CBD-88BE-9D907EB51387,GDV1 triggers sexual conversion and differentiation in malaria parasites by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing,"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that proliferate through iterative cycles of intra-erythrocytic replication. During each cycle a small number of parasites differentiate into gametocytes, the only forms able to infect the mosquito vector and transmit malaria. Sexual commitment is triggered by activation of AP2-G, the master transcriptional regulator of gametocytogenesis. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)-dependent silencing of ap2-g prevents sexual conversion and secures proliferation. Here, we identify gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) as the first upstream activator of the sexual differentiation pathway in P. falciparum. Induction of GDV1 expression is sufficient to activate AP2-G expression and sexual differentiation. We found that GDV1 targets heterochromatin and triggers HP1 eviction preferentially at ap2-g and other gametocyte-specific genes. We further demonstrate that GDV1-dependent activation of ap2-g is controlled via a gdv1 antisense RNA. In summary, we identify GDV1 as an unprecedented cell fate decision factor that induces sexual differentiation by antagonizing HP1-dependent gene silencing.",doi: 10.1126/science.aan6042,2018-03-15,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94901,GEO

The him-5(e1490) genetic background results in an increased frequency of males in the population. We used an anti-FLAG antibody for the IP and semi-synchronous populations of animals in the L3 and L4 larval stages as samples. The purpose of the experiment was to identify LIN41 mRNA targets in the soma. From the three independent replicates, we determined a set of LIN41-bound mRNAs using edgeR and FDR < 0.05 as a cutoff. This set contained only seven mRNAs, the previously known targets lin-29, mab-10, mab-3 and dmd-3 (Aeschimann et al., Mol Cell, 2017), as well as lin-41 and the unannotated genes F18C5.10 and C31H5.5.

Intersecting this experiment with differential gene expression experiments upon dys-regulation of LIN41 (Aeschimann et al., Mol Cell, 2017) and phenotypic analysis of mutant strains, we further conclude that during larval development, LIN41 likely regulates only a four direct targets, namely lin-29, mab-10, mab-3 and dmd-3. Additionally, the lin-41 mRNA could be directly targeted by LIN41 as well, but the detection of lin-41 mRNA in the IPs may result from the immunoprecipitation of nascent FLAG::GFP::LIN41 protein, still bound to the translating ribosome on its own mRNA.",GSE120405,2018-11-15,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120405,GEO
163447,96A28109-E38F-4711-BBF7-C3A84D086FF7,Post-transcriptional regulation by the let-7 microRNA and the TRIM-NHL protein LIN41 [Ribosome footprinting],"We perform RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling time course experiments to examine the effect of fully dysregulating all let-7 targets (in let-7(n2853) animals), partially dysregulating only LIN41 (in lin-41(xe11) animals) or fully dysregulating all let-7 targets while partially dysregulating LIN41 in lin-41(xe11); let-7(n2853) double mutant animals. We conclude that effects on gene expression in let-7 mutant animals are largely and quantitatively explained by dysregulation of LIN41 as its primary target. Furthermore, we identify direct LIN41 target genes regulated on the level of translation or mRNA abundance.",GSE80133,2017-07-17,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80133,GEO
